The main axes of work are food security, environmental protection, natural resource management (in particular water resources), and institutional strengthening of partner and community-based organisations. Two development workers are supporting the local partner organisation through (i) sustainable agricultural production and use of natural resources through agro-forestry and (ii) crop diversification and introduction of small livestock emphasising a balanced diet and proper use of food products in terms of food and nutrition security. The project is reaching 1,800 direct and 9,000 indirect beneficiaries in the northern border region of the Dominican Republic. Food Security: Rehabilitation of agricultural productivity of watersheds in central and north-eastern Haiti in support of gardening and fruit production(2) This project focuses on strengthening of the capacities of community-based organisations and farmersâ€™ associations of the departments of central and north-east Haiti, contributing to the fight against poverty and food and nutrition insecurity. The project also aims to improve environmental protection and management of natural resources, in order to enhance the productivity and sustainable development of the target communities. The empowerment of women and farmers is also a key part of the project as well as advocacy to increase investment in Haitian agriculture and production. The expected immediate effects of the project include: i) environmental, with an increase in hectares of agricultural land protected or saved from erosion and degradation, and volume of water retained and controlled for agricultural use; ii) production, with an expected increase of agricultural assets and productive units through more efficient management oriented towards local consumption and income generation; iii) marketing and trade, to increase the income level of families through processing activities and joint commercial initiatives; iv) organisational, through improved internal operating conditions of farmersâ€™ associations and community-based organisations, and more effective participation in processes and strategies to promote local food security. The project is reaching 500 direct and 2,500 indirect beneficiaries in the communities of Gens de Nantes, Lamine and Ouanaminthe (north-east Haiti). Strengthening the disaster risk management capacities of Caritas Haiti(3) The project aims to strengthen the coordination, the technical and the organisational capacities of the Disaster Risk Management Unit of Caritas Haiti National Office and to mainstream disaster risk reduction institutionally and on all levels. It is expected that at the end of the project, Caritas Haiti National Office has been institutionally strengthened in development, planning, monitoring and evaluation of disaster risk reduction programmes and projects at the national, regional and local level, in order to better address the problems and needs of their beneficiaries. This will lead to improved coordination of disaster mitigation programmes in particular at the community level, and in general a raised profile at the national and international level in terms of disaster risk management. Key components of institutional strengthening include the definition and structuring of rapid response mechanisms for emergency response, design of contingency plans for all three levels, the establishment of an emergency fund through development of projects linked to sustainable and resilient livelihood and the pre-positioning of emergency supplies and storage of non-food products as part of a preparedness strategy. Strengthening the management capacity of agricultural producers in the border communities of the province of ElÃ_as PiÃ±a (Dominican Republic) and the department of Plateau Central (Haiti)(4) This project will contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the population in the province of ElÃ_as PiÃ±a and the department Plateau Central, through improved conditions and coverage for exchange and collaboration between non-state actors and local authorities of ElÃ_as PiÃ±a and Plateau Central in issues of common cross-border interest, such as agricultural production and trade, culture and environment. The expected results are: i) the creation and management of an office for marketing of agricultural production in the Municipality of Comendador (province ElÃ_as PiÃ±a), in order to reinforce the structure and channels of local and bi-national trade and marketing; ii) creation and management of a cross-border Museum for Culture and Environment, to promote the development of environmental and cultural services within the framework of a cross-border plan for sustainable eco-tourism; iii) promotion of a process of strengthening capacities for governance and local management of municipal authorities, in order to enhance and construct a bi-national dialogue. The project is reaching out to 555 direct and 28,700 indirect beneficiaries in the communities of ElÃ_as PiÃ±a and Plateau Central in the southern Dominican-Haitian border. Building citizenship(5) This project will strengthen the capacity of non-state actors and local authorities in the provinces of Independencia and ElÃ_as PiÃ±a. The overall goal is to strengthen the coordination between local authorities and civil society organisations regarding the planning of local development and the development of municipal policies that respond to the needs of the population of 23 municipalities of the southern border provinces of DR and Haiti. Specifically, it seeks greater coordination between Dominican and Haitian border municipalities, and increased participation and coordination between civil society and local authorities for inclusive and sustainable local development. The project is supporting about 2,300 direct beneficiaries and approximately 26,000 indirect beneficiaries. Building together local governance based on participation and planning(6) This project aims to contribute to the strengthening of local governance in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the implementation of citizen participation spaces established within the framework of the Municipal Law 176-07 in the Dominican Republic and promoting partnerships between municipalities on the Haitian side and cross-border. The specific objective is to strengthen the capacity of non-state actors and local authorities in terms of the implementation of public policies, particularly the mechanisms of citizen participation, gender equity and planning established in the Law 176-07, in favour of local development. It also aims to strengthen the Haitian Federation of Municipalities as an ideal space to promote governance and reconstruction of Haiti and further strengthening the ties between the two nations. Regarding civil society, with which Progressio assume a key role in the implementation of the action, it is foreseen to strengthen public participation, enhancing the knowledge of citizens about their rights, duties and participation mechanisms, especially the Municipal Law 176-07 and promoting advocacy for its compliance. In addition, the project will strengthen the knowledge and resources of local authorities to fulfil their duties and thus create the conditions to plan and reach a consensus for municipal actions and policies that are inclusive for the welfare of all. Handicrafts of the Border: promoting employment and social cohesion in ElÃ_as PiÃ±a (Dominican Republic) and Plateau Central (Haiti)(7) The overall objective of this project is to increase social cohesion between local authorities and Dominican and Haitian civil society in the border towns of Elias PiÃ±a (Dominican Republic) and Plateau Central (Haiti) by implementing joint local development actions that lead to a public-private partnership for job creation in the local and bi-national handicrafts sector. The project represents a set of solutions in technical, economic, social and cultural terms intended to promote the development of the handicraft sector on both sides of the border. The expected outcomes are: i) artisans of the municipalities of ElÃ_as PiÃ±a and Plateau Central improve technical and business management skills through the implementation of municipal spaces for technical training and craft production; ii) the Municipal Association of Artisans and its network on provincial level interact with local authorities and bi-national coordination and consultation bodies, in order to constitute territorial agreements for the sector; iii) the provincial network of the Municipal Association of Artisans, in coordination with public and private stakeholders, is engaged in support and promotion of handicrafts. Strengthening the capacity of the state and civil society to promote, manage and coordinate actions to prevent, detect, address and penalise violence against women(8) The aim of this project is to accompany local actors from the border area to prevent violence against women. This is a follow-up project that monitors the processes that began in May 2011 with the project 'Gender-based violence prevention and response to the needs of women in the border between Haiti and Dominican Republicâ€ù and the project â€œPrevention and attention of violence against women in the border provincesâ€ù implemented during 2012 by Progressio and co-funded by UNFPA and UN Women. The project â€œPrevention and attention of violence against womenâ€ù seeks to ensure that local organizations and authorities (municipalities, prosecutors, medical centres etc) in the provinces of DajabÃ_n, ElÃ_as PiÃ±a, Independencia, Pedernales, Santiago and Monte Cristi coordinate with each other to carry out action plans that are viable and specific for the prevention and attention of violence against women in their provinces. In the current phase, Progressioâ€™s development worker is accompanying and monitoring these organisations and institutions in order to consolidate joint initiatives of action plans for each province, to consolidate and strengthen the Management Committees formed in 2012 and to support awareness-raising and advocacy activities. Rebuilding a new and all-inclusive Haiti: strengthening Haitian civil society in rebuilding their country(9) The overall project goal is to strengthen Haitian civil society in their efforts to build a new Haiti which is socially inclusive and transparent. This project responds to the demands of civil society after the Haitian earthquake in January 2010, particularly over the lack of transparency and accountability on reconstruction plans and policies and aid distribution, and the lack of effective civil society participation in policy-making on reconstruction and development of Haiti. This new Haiti aims to break with the past where decisions were made without citizen participation and coordination, and where centralisation still limits regional and local development and rights are poorly respected. The specific objective of the project is to track and analyse the actions taken in the framework of the countryâ€™s reconstruction through the Observatory of Public Policy and International Cooperation and divulge objective and reliable data on international cooperation, public policies and the situation of Haitians, especially the most vulnerable sectors of the population, to Haitian civil society, national and international stakeholders. Added to this, internationally, Progressio works to influence decision-makers in the UK and Europe on the reconstruction of Haiti and raise public awareness of the problems facing the country. Advocacy and communication, with an emphasis on public policy related to the strengthening of the Dominican-Haitian relations(10) This project aims to strengthen the capacities in advocacy and communication of the local partner Centro BonÃ_ and the processes of national and bi-national platforms created between networks and coalitions working with the institution, in order to contribute to the fight against poverty and social exclusion. This includes strengthening communication and media strategies, which include production of press notes and audiovisual broadcasting material for different media and digital networks and monitoring and media analysis. The development worker will also support the different processes led by Centro BonÃ_ to strengthen Dominican-Haitian relations, both on the political and institutional level as well as on the grassroots level. Institutional strengthening, with emphasis on design and project management, of Funcar-Centro Puente in DajabÃ_n(11) This project aims to strengthen the capacities of the staff of the local organization Funcar-Centro Puente on both sides of the northern border, and local grassroots organizations they work with, in particular womenâ€™s associations, in design, planning and implementation of sustainable initiatives, with special emphasis on empowerment and income-generating activities for rural women. The development worker will also provide support on gender equality issues, communication and advocacy. It is expected that at the end of the project the organisation has been supported in the development of methodological guidelines and tools for assessment, monitoring and evaluation, allowing a better systematisation of results, impacts and lessons learned within implemented projects. The development worker will also contribute to the intercultural and bi-national approach promoted within the partner organisation and beneficiary grassroots organisations on both sides of the border. Institutional strengthening and capacity building for the identification and implementation of an agroforestry school at the Centre JesÃºs Peregrino in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic(12) This project will assist the Centre JesÃºs Peregrino to set up an agroforestry school as part of the institutional strategy of the Centre. The development worker will develop in collaboration with the local staff the necessary tools for soil studies, organisational assessments directed to the beneficiary grassroots organisations, as well as monitoring and evaluation of activities. The development worker will also provide capacity building for the technical team of the Centre in the implementation of an agroforestry training school and strengthening of their skills in agroforestry and agro-ecological production.",2,,7/1/09,2/1/16,,0,285365.93,118647.07,404013,;DFID,,,";Progressio;Solidaridad Fronteriza ;Municipality of Ozama;Municipality of Yuma;Municipality of Higuamo;Municipality of Valdesia;Municipality of El Valle;Municipality of Enriquillo;Municipality of Cibao Sur, Northeast and Northwest;Municipality of Cibao North;Comitato Internazionale per lo Sviluppo dei Popoli (CISP);Associazione Artigiani della Provincia di Vicenza â€“ Confartigfianato Vicenza Italian-Dominican Chamber of Commerce;CERFAS;Centro BonÃ_;Foundation for Cultural Exchange between Caribbean People (Funcar)-Centro Puente;Centro de AtenciÃ_n JesÃºs Peregrino (Ascala);Federation of Dominican Municipalities (FEDOMU);Municipality of Comedador/ElÃ_as PiÃ±a ;Caritas Haiti;Mouvement Paysan Papaye (Hinche);SolidaritÃ© Fwontalye (Ouanaminthe)",;,DO;HT,;,,,,;;;;;;;,DAC;DAC;DAC;DAC;DAC;DAC;DAC;DAC,31120;52010;74010;31120;15140;32140;15150;32162,;;;;;;;555,Progressio,belisario@progressio.org.uk,en,GBP,3/28/13 20:28,Progressio,GB-CHC-294329,21,GB-CHC-294329-Yemen,Yemen,"Enhancing civil society organizationsâ€™ capacity to support civic activism and advocate for effective local governance and womenâ€™s political participation(1) The aim of the project is to enable poor and marginalised people, especially women, to have greater influence on decisions and policies which affect their lives in order to reduce their poverty. The Yemeni constitution guarantees equality in rights and obligations for both men and women, including the right of political participation and participation in decision-making. Nevertheless, womenâ€™s political rights and participation in decision-making processes are yet to be realized. The project will build a solid platform of local people â€“ poor, marginalized, women â€“ to be able to influence government plans and policies. Project activities will include capacity building of civil society organisations, particularly in relation to advocacy campaigns; civic education and awareness-raising; building citizensâ€™ networks; and promoting effective governance by supporting citizen involvement in policy and planning processes. This will improve the level of representation of people who are poor and marginalised by civil society organisations engaging with national government.

Initially Faulu Kenya focused on micro enterprise lending in Mathare slums of Nairobi. However, over the last 17 years, as lending methodologies and systems were improved, Faulu Kenya grew to become a company with 31 branches and a presence in most districts of Kenya. The objective of this project is to support Faulu Kenya as it transforms from a credit only institution to a regulated deposit taking institution. This transformation is characterized both by the development of a broader product offering as well as by the formalization of the shareholding structure and regulatory framework the institution adheres to. The addition of liability products will provide secure savings to clients as well as more control over funding and asset liability management for the institution. The shareholding structure will evolve, as the original NGO founder will be reduced from a majority owner to a minority shareholder, bringing a more commercial ownership and governance structure to match the more formal role Faulu Kenya will play in the financial sector.

This project has been envisioned and implemented by BASE in partnership with World Vision Advocacy Forum (WVAF). The project is intervened in mid and far- western district namely Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur of Nepal. The project supports over 186,000 of Nepal's ex-kamaiya community (freed bonded labourers). In 2000, following peaceful civil society protests, the Government of Nepal abolished the kamaiya system but the ex-kamaiyas are extremely poor, without land or livelihoods. Almost 15% have not received their rehabilitation packages because most are unaware of their entitlements and because accessing them is obstructed by bureacracy, inefficiency and corruption. Un- and under-employment is high, with 69% experiencing income/food insecurity for at least nine months/year. Evidence suggests that 11% of children are out-of-school and likely to be in child labour. The project aims to support ex-kamaiyas to gain their entitlements, to mobilise them for savings and credit, and to provide vocational training. The ex-kamaiyas will increase their incomes and gain productive employment; children (with a focus on girls) will be supported to attend school and complete primary education. ;Contribute to achieve MDG's No 1, 2 & 3 Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education Goal3: Promote gender equality and empower women ;10077 nos of Ex Kamaiya Families",2,4/1/14,,,,0,0,0,0,;The Department for International Development (DFID) Global Poverty Action Fund (GPAF),,,,England,GB,,,,,,,,1105,EMMS International,Cathy.Ratcliff@emms.org,en,GBP,8/7/14 12:11,EMMS International,GB-OSCR-SC032327,21,GB-OSCR-SC032327-MW,Malawi programme,"Palliative care, Addressing Disease and Disability, Maternal and Child Health",2,,5/1/12,8/31/16,,0,132341,0,0,;Scottish Government ;EMMS International;Private donors,,,";CCAP Livingstonia (LISAP, Ekwendeni College of Health Sciences, Health Department) ;Nkhoma Mission Hospital;Mulanje Mission Hospital;Palliative Care Support Trust",,MW,,,,,Health,RO,,1001224,EMMS International,Cathy.Ratcliff@emms.org,en,GBP,8/7/14 12:04,EMMS International,GB-OSCR-SC032327,21,GB-OSCR-SC032327-IN,India - BHARAT,"Maternal and Child Health, Disease and Disability, and Palliative Care, in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi. ;à_®à__à__à¥ƒ à_èà_µà_‚ à_¶à_¿à_¿à¥Å à_¸à¥çà_µà__à_¸à¥çà_¥à_¯, à_¬à¥€à_®à__à_°à¥€ à_“à_° à_µà_µà_•à__à__à_‚à_—à__à__ à_“à_° à_¿à__à_¨à¥çà__à__ à__à¥‡à_¨à¥‡à_µà__à__à__ à__à¥‡à_–à__à__à__, à_µà_µà__à__à_°, à_®à_§à¥çà_¯ à_ªà¥çà_°à__à¥‡à_¿, à_‰à__à¥çà__à_° à_ªà¥çà_°à__à¥‡à_¿, à_ùà__à_°à_–à_£à_¡ à_“à_° à__à__à__à¥çà__à¥€ à_®à¥‡à¥_",2,,2012-01-02;2012-01-02,2019-11-30;2019-11-30,,0,385240,0,0,,,,;EMMS International;Emmanual Hospital Association,"Particularly Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi;à_‡à_‚à_¡à_¿à_¯à__ à__à__à_°à__ à_µà_µà_¿à¥‡à_· à_°à¥Åà_ªà_¸à¥‡ à_µà_µà__à__à_°, à_®à_§à¥çà_¯ à_ªà¥çà_°à__à¥‡à_¿, à__à__à__à¥çà__à¥€à¥_",IN;IN,;,South & Central Asia,689,100,3 à_•à__à_¯à__à_•à¥çà_°à_®: à_®à__à__à¥ƒ à_èà_µà_‚ à_¶à_¿à_¿à¥Å à_¸à¥çà_µà__à_¸à¥çà_¥à_¯ à_¿à__à_¨à¥çà__à__ à__à¥‡à_¨à¥‡à_µà__à__à__ à__à¥‡à_–à__à__à__ à_¬à¥€à_®à__à_°à¥€ à_“à_° à_µà_µà_•à__à__à_‚à_—à__à__;3 programmes: Maternal and Child Health Palliative Care Disease and Disability,RO;RO,;,;1225,EMMS International,Cathy.Ratcliff@emms.org,en,GBP,8/7/14 12:17,EMMS International,GB-OSCR-SC032327,21,GB-OSCR-SC032327-NP,Nepal,"Maternal and Child Health in Deukhuri, Dang District. ;à_®à__à__à¥ƒ à__à_¥à__ à_¶à_¿à_¿à¥Å à_¸à¥çà_µà__à_¸à¥çà¥çà_¯, à__à¥‡à_‰à_–à¥Åà_°à¥€, à_œà_¿à__à¥çà__à__ à__à__à_™",2,,7/1/14,,,0,37500,0,0,,,,;à_ˆà_¨à¥çà_Ÿà_°à_¨à¥‡à_¿à_¨à__ à_¨à¥‡à_ªà__à__ à_«à¥‡à__à¥‹à_¶à_¿à_ª-à_¨à¥‡à_ªà__à__;EMMS International ;International Nepal Fellowship - Nepal,"Rural, West Nepal;à_—à¥çà_°à__à_¶à_®à_£, à_ªà_œ à__à_¿à_® à_¨à¥‡à_ªà__à__",NP;NP,;,,,,à_®à__à__à¥ƒ à__à_¥à__ à_¶à_¿à_¿à¥Å à_¸à¥çà_µà__à_¸à¥çà¥çà_¯;Maternal and Child Health.,RO;RO,;,;1226,EMMS International,Cathy.Ratcliff@emms.org,en,GBP,6/29/14 13:24,EMMS International,GB-OSCR-SC032327,21,GB-OSCR-SC032327-Organisation,"Consultancies, partners' travel, evaluations","To pay for consultancies, partners' travel, unbudgeted evaluations, unbudgeted small projects",2,,1/1/14,,,0,202,0,0,,,,;EMMS International,;;,IN;MW;NP,33.3;33.3;33.3,,,,"3 programmes: Maternal and Child Health, Palliative Care, Disease and Disability",RO,,1227,EMMS International,Cathy.Ratcliff@emms.org,en,GBP,8/7/14 12:22,EMMS International,GB-OSCR-SC032327,21,GB-OSCR-SC032327-UK,UK programme,"Grants for people with terminal illnesses, living in or near Edinburgh, to take a holiday with family.

For communities living in the Niger Delta, gas flaring is the most visible and insidious representation of the oil industry. Nigeria has approximately 180 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, the seventh largest in the world, currently exporting around 3 billion cubic ft. per day and flaring around 2.5 billion cubic ft. per day; equal to 30% of the entire EUâ€™s annual gas consumption. However, only 0.5 billion cubic feet per day is supplied to the domestic power sector, despite 70% of the population not having access to electricity or modern energy services. Harnessing gas from the flares to meet local energy needs is critical to local development in the region.;The Gas to Power demonstration project will utilise associated gas from either a flow station or oil well and using a micro turbine, generate electricity for domestic and small business consumption. The project will deploy a 0.5 MW gas turbine to produce and distribute electricity to around 3,000 households, 500 small businesses, 5 health centres and 6 schools. A strong community ownership element has been built into the project design; the entire assets and operations will be managed and maintained by a community-based utility company, owned by the community. The siting of the project will be preceded by a technical feasibility and economic viability assessment since the project aims at full cost recovery. In addition to electricity generation, the project has scope to incorporate other components including gas to liquid and gas to fertiliser, and these additions will operate on a fully commercial basis. This is the first time in Nigeria that a community will generate its own power from a hi-tech micro turbine rather then unsustainable diesel generators that create high levels of pollution.

Objectives The Alliance seeks to: â€¢ Hold Southern African governments accountable for the achievement of gender equality through signing, ratifying, and implementating the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development, a sub-regional roadmap for MDG 3 (gender equality). â€¢ Lobby Southern African governments to be to adopt an Addendum to the SADC Gender Protocol on Gender and Climate change. â€¢ Strengthen the capacity of civil society, especially gender NGOs, to demand that governments deliver on commitments to gender equality. â€¢ Empower citizens especially women, to become aware of the SADC Gender Protocol, engage critically with governments to claim their rights; and demand effective and responsive governance. Activities In 2011/2012 the Alliance: â€¢ Held eight reference group meetings to validate the findings of the SADC Gender Protocol Country Barometers. â€¢ Produced the 2011 SADC Gender Protocol Barometer, introducing the Southern African Gender and Development Index (SGDI). The report also featured 44 case studies demonstrating the SADC Gender Protocol @ Work. The Alliance launched the Barometer in Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, and Zimbabwe and Angola. â€¢ Held the Alliance annual meeting in August 2011, conducted a SWOT analysis of the institutional mechanisms and Programme of Action. A strategy session identified two regional campaigns to focus on in 2011/2012: the Fifty-fifty as well as gender and climate change campaigns. The meeting elected an Alliance Think Tank to work with the Secretariat in guiding its work. â€¢ Assisted two countries, Namibia and Seychelles, to develop costed Gender Action Plans aligned to the SADC Gender Protocol. Seychelle is the first SADC country to align its Gender Policy to the 28 targets of the SADC Gender Protocol. â€¢ Tracked implementation of the key provisions of the Gender Protocol through the monthly e-newsletter, Roadmap to Equality: Southern Africa Gender and Development Barometer. â€¢ Held 143 village meetings. â€¢ Disseminated over 6000 simplified versions of the SADC Gender Protocol in SADCâ€™s three main languages (English, French and Portuguese) as well as 23 Indigenous languages. â€¢ Strengthenied the institutional base the Alliance Network: Three more country networks signed MOUs. Strong lead organisations have emerged for the faith based and menâ€™s sector. Theme clusters have started to take the lead in their areas (see ISS example below). Peace and security regional theme cluster Since the Institute of Security Studies (ISS) took the lead on gender, peace and security within the Alliance, four national working groups have been established in Zimbabwe, Malawi, DRC and Madagascar. These are all countries experiencing characterised by political conflict and violence. Each of the country focal points has convened at least one meeting as part of replicating the structure at national level. In Madagascar, this culminated in a National Conference on Gender, Peace and Security in November 2011. Early results include increased awareness on Article 28 of the SADC Gender Protocol; successful lobbying and advocacy by clusters for development of national action plans on UNSCR 1325 by SADC countries; increased womenâ€™s representation in the peace and security sectors at regional and country level. ISS comments: â€œThe Alliance needs more strategic planning exercises â€“ one once a year is not sufficient. We will continue to work with Gender Links to strengthen the Alliance. The formation of an alliance think tank, when operative should go far in consolidating the work.â€ù For full profile go to http://www.genderlinks.org.za/page/sadc-gender-protocol-partners The SADC Protocol @ work â€“ Gender and climate change At the launch of the 2010 SADC Gender Protocol Barometer, Alliance partners in Mozambique pointed out that the SADC Gender Protocol is silent on sustainable development and climate change. In 2011, the Alliance embarked on a campaign calling for an Addendum to the SADC Gender Protocol on Gender and Climate Change as a way of influencing regional policy building on past successes. The October 2011 Gender Ministers meeting in Winsdhoek noted the importance of integrating gender into climate policies. In November 2011 the Alliance regional Secretariat gave technical inputs at the Gender/Womenâ€™s Affairs Ministers and Senior Officials meetings to engender the SADC Regional Strategy for the 17th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework for the Convention on Climate Change (COP 17). Building on the momentum of COP 17 the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance has launched a petition calling on SADC governments to adopt, as matter of urgency, the principle of an Addendum or amendments to the Gender Protocol â€“ see http://www.genderlinks.org.za/page/sadc-climate-change. The Gender and Climate Change petition campaign is up on the GL website as another way of enlisting citizens to support the campaign for an Addendum to the SADC Gender Protocol on Gender and Climate Change, with 100 signatures so far. Outputs â€¢ The 2011 SADC Gender Protocol Barometer.This features the SGDI and 44 case studies of the SADC Gender Protocol @ Work. â€¢ A gender policy (Seychelles) and gender action plans aligned to the SADC Protocol in Namibia and Seychelles. â€¢ An additional four MOUs between Gender Links as the Secretariat and Alliance focal organisations from Angola (Platform for Women Action), Tanzania (Tanzania Gender Networking Project) and Zambia (Women in Law Southern Africa â€“ Zambia) and with Botswana Council of NGOs as regional theme cluster lead for the Education Sector. This brings the total number MOUs signed to 21. â€¢ A draft Addendum to the Protocol on Gender and Climate Change. Outreach Direct beneficiaries: GL held 143 village level workshops (three more than the target number). GL also held six country reference group meetings for the Barometer and five launches. In total the programme reached 5103 people directly: 3202 (63%) women and 1901 (37%) men. Indirect beneficiaries: The programme reached an estimated 55,245 beneficiaries through indirect methods. These include: website hits (the alliance website (www.sadcgenderprotocol.org) received 35 701 unique hits from March 2011 and February 2012). The Alliance also used the GL list-serve, new media channels, media outreach, GL publications, ten issues of the Roadmap to Equality e-newsletter; the pamphlet on the Alliance in English, French, and Portuguese and 6000 additional copies of the SADC Gender Protocol in indigenous languages to reach a wide audience. Ripple effects: The SADC Protocol in Chiredzi A team of GL staff arrive an hour late for a meeting with the Chiredzi Centre of Excellence (COE) for Gender in Local Government, but the 46 women gathered under a tree continue with their monthly 50/50 campaign meeting. The community mobilisers in this sugar-growing hub of south east Zimbabwe are engrossed in the Shona and Ndebele pamphlet on the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development provided through the Southern African Gender Protocol Alliance. Several interest groups explain enthusiastically how they have been applying the sub-regional instrument with 28 targets by 2015 (the same year as the Millennium Development Goals) in their daily lives. They include aspiring councillors (Zimbabwe is due to hold elections later this year); widows; caregivers; informal traders; unemployed women; survivors of gender violence; those fighting trafficking to neighbouring South Africa and sex workers. The hot button issue is a petition led by the councilâ€™s gender champion, Bernadette Chipembere, for the release of dozens of women rounded up by police during a crack down on sex workers. The women argue that police should also target the male clients of sex workers. One of the winners in the 2010 Gender Justice Local Government Summit, Councillor Chipembere (see profile:http://www.genderlinks.org.za/article/bernadette-chipembere-2012-05-28) has made sure her council develops a gender action plan; monitors local police action on gender violence, helps widows fight legal battles, and promotes womenâ€™s economic empowerment. Inspired by the national launch of the 50/50 campaign as part of the Southern African Gender Protocol Alliance governance cluster activities (http://www.genderlinks.org.za/page/sadc-thematic-clusters), Chipembere vowed to take the campaign door to door in her community, targeting the poorest neighbourhood (known as majarada) where families share rooms and toilet facilities. â€œAs a councillor I cannot just sit there and say, â€˜I do policyâ€™ when things are not right on the ground,â€ù says Chipembere. â€œIf you do not get on the ground, you cannot be effective.â€ù Outcomes Commitment: The SADC Gender Protocol officially went into force in August 2011 after South Africa ratified the Protocol. Malawi could be next. Tracking continues through the Annual Barometer and the Roadmap to Equality e-newsletter. Momentum to get the last two member states to sign: The Gender Links Mauritius Office working with MWO-GEMSA, the Alliance focal network in Mauritius, played a pivotal role in the passing of the Local Government Act providing for a quota of 30% women in elections scheduled for July. This necessitated a constitutional amendment removing a key stumbling block to Mauritius signing the Protocol â€“ see http://www.genderlinks.org.za/article/a-giant-step-towards-gender-equality-local-government-act-provides-for-legislated-quota-2012-05-29. The Alliance focal point in Botswana led by the Botswana Council of NGOs (BOCONGO) has crafted a strategy for putting pressure on the Botswana government to sign. Holding governments to account through the SGDI: The third Barometer produced in 2011 helps the region establish a monitoring and evaluation mechanism against which progress can be measured. The innovation, the Southern Africa Gender Development Index introduced in the 2011 SADC Gender Protocol Barometer provides a measurement towards attainment of gender equality against the SADC Gender Protocol 28 targets. Based on 23 indicators across six sectors, the SGDI puts SADC at 64% of where they need to be towards meeting the 28 targets 2015. Implementation: Seychelles developed a draft gender policy which is the first to be completely aligned to the SADC Gender Protocol targets set for 2015. Namibia officially adopted its policy. Namiia and Seychelles have blazed the train in SADC by drafting gender action plans that are aligned to the SADC Gender Protocol. Namibia realigns its gender policy By: Emily Brown Under the theme â€œConnecting Girls, Inspiring Futuresâ€ù, young boys and girls of pre-school age commenced proceedings to celebrate International Womenâ€™s Day, 8 March 2012, with a song conveying a message of love. Together with a strong representation of NGOâ€™s, civil society, the Diplomatic corps and governmental agencies, Minister of Gender Equality and Child Welfare Doreen Sioka set the tone for the event when she said: â€œThis is no ordinary day!â€ù Speaking at the launch of the revised National Gender Policy (2010 â€“ 2020), President Hifikepunye Pohamba said that the Policy is one of the Namibian Governmentâ€™s most important interventions to address injustices caused by gender imbalance in society. According to Namibiaâ€™s Head of State, the implementation of the Policy would create synergies for the achievement of national development objectives. The President informed the audience that it is his belief that the peopleâ€™s enjoyment of freedom is compromised when threatened by gender-based violence. Lives, he said, are frequently disrupted by such acts. President Pohamba said, in light of this social reality, mechanisms have been put in place to empower women. This, he said, required of Government to ensure that the Gender Policy remains current. Taking stock of what had been achieved through the previous Gender Policy (1997), President Pohamba pointed out that through its implementation progress had been made in terms of a significant increase in the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary school. He said Namibia is on track with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGâ€™s), and that such achievements should make us proud. However, the President cautioned that, despite the existence of progressive laws, the evil of gender-based violence continues in Namibian society. President Pohamba said that when women are empowered, nations are empowered and that this translates into a better and safer world. He added that a gender perspective must consistently be reflected in all our policies and programmes. In this regard, he said, a gender Task Force/Advisory Board on Gender has been established. Furthermore, he stated that the Policy must guide action and the mainstreaming of gender in the National Development framework. This, he said, should lead to gender equality in Namibia. Section 42 of the revised Gender Policy, which focuses on â€˜Gender Education and Trainingâ€™, states in paragraph 4.2.17 that the government shall â€œensure that curricula, textbooks and all teaching/learning materials are free from genderâ€“stereotyped references and illustrations at all levels of education, including teacher training programmesâ€ù. As a media trainer, the launch reminded me of how much we have to do to ensure womenâ€™s equal voice in the media. Prior to the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup in South Africa, governments in SADC, especially, started to assess the implications of such an event â€“ especially for women and children. In the region we started to see a great deal more coverage of human trafficking and gender violence. Namibia, for example, is one of the countries to have ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, as well as the additional Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Humans, especially women and children, in 2003. Act No. 29 of 2004 â€“ The Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA) â€“ which criminalises trafficking in persons was also enacted. According to the â€œBaseline Assessment of Human Trafficking in Namibiaâ€ù (Ministry of Gender and Child Welfare, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry, June 2009), limited reporting suggests Namibia may be a source and destination country for trafficked children. But, the magnitude of this problem is not entirely known, even though it is suspected that most of the trafficking victims are children. In a US Department of State Report entitled â€œTrafficking in Personsâ€ù (TIP) (June 2008), Namibia has been designated a â€œSpecial Caseâ€ù because there is insufficient reliable information on the countryâ€™s trafficking circumstances, even though a trafficking problem is suspected. In terms of the Namibian Study, many of the respondents were completely unaware of any existing legal framework to deal with human trafficking, though some knew of the Labour Act. Pushing the envelope: Significant progress has been achieved towards the adoption of an Addendum to the SADC Gender Protocol on gender and climate change. The idea is firmly on the agenda of SADC Ministers responsible for Womenâ€™s Affairs/Gender. This is evidenced by the adopted minutes in November 2011 at a United National Conference of the Parties (COP17) preparatory meeting and per the White Paper prepared by the SADC Secretariat. The Alliance has drafted an Addendum that will be canvassed with civil society before taking to national governments to lobby for language. Gender Links led the Alliance partners in giving inputs into the SADC Regional Strategy on Climate as agreed by the SADC Climate Change Positioning Workshop to ensure that the strategy was gender sensitive. These suggestions were forwarded to the Senior officials meeting and adopted by the Ministers meeting. Strengthening civil society: GL has contributed to strengthened capacity of civil society, especially gender NGOs to demand that governments deliver on commitments against the provisions of the Protocol through signing a total of 23 MOUs with Alliance focal networks in 15 SADC countries National Focal. Of these eight are sector MOUs as targeted in 2011. Fact file: Civil societyâ€™s distinctive contribution â€¢ In 2005 regional gender NGOS led by GL conducted an audit of the SADC Declaration on Gender and Development that led to a paper on why the Declaration should be elevated to a Protocol. â€¢ Civil society joined the task force formed by SADC Gender Unit responsible for drafting the SADC Gender Protocol and made substantial inputs into the seven drafts of the Protocol. â€¢ In 2008 the Alliance made a major push for the adoption of the Protocol by SADC Heads of State meeting in Johannesburg. â€¢ Soon after the adoption of the Protocol, the Alliance developed a range of IEC materials including pamhplets in 23 languages, radio materials and posters. â€¢ By 2010 all SADC except Botswana and Mauritius had signed the Protocol. In August 2010 South Africa became the ninth country to ratify the Protocol, resulting on the instrument going into force. â€¢ Country focal networks of the Alliance have mounted campaigns for Botswana and Mauritius to ratify the Protocol. â€¢ While governments have only submitted one set of reports on their performance agains the targets of the SADC Gender Protocol, the Alliance has produced three issues of the SADC Gender Protocol and Developed the SADC Gender and Development Index to press for change. â€¢ The Alliance convened an expert group meeting together with SADC GU and UN Women to develop a methodology and process of costing the SADC Gender Protocol. This has been tested in two SADC countries â€“ Namibia and Seychelles. At the time of writing six other countries had committed to aling their national action plans to SADC targets. â€¢ The Alliance has single handedly put the issue of Gender and Climate Change on the regional gender agenda. Movement for change: The SADC Gender Protocol is creating momentum for change in many sectors across society, including Faith Based Organisations. Churches follow the government lead http://gemcommunity.genderlinks.org.za/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=14124 â€œChurch leadership is slowly realising that it is up to them to put meat to gender policies, operationalise them and demonstrate to political and other leaders how these issues of gender should be tackled. The church in Zambia is still grappling with how exactly to amplify its voice on issues of gender. We need to start with a baseline study of women in leadership in churches. Women are in churches and they are serving diligently, but we do not see them in leadership. Recently the church mother bodies in Zambia met to discuss how the church could take up MDG 3 on gender equality and specifically address GBV. The church has begun to actively engage on various thematic areas such as quota systems, GBV policy and gender policies.â€ù - Reverand Rosemary Nsofwa, Zambia. Read more on: http://www.genderlinks.org.za/article/rosemary-nsofwa---zambia-2012-06-06 Challenges The Alliance has remained a loose â€œcoalition of the willingâ€ù meaning that commitments to the campaign are not binding and dependent on the will of the Network members. Because the Alliance is not a formally registered Network resource mobilisation is a challenge. While a number of theme cluster leaders have managed to raise resources for the work related to the cluster, much of the responsibility rests with the regional secretariat. Next steps â€¢ Work with five more countries to develop costed National Gender Action Plans in the coming year. â€¢ Rroduce the fourth edition, 2012 SADC Gender Protocol Barometer, as a measure of governmentâ€™s progress towards realising the 28 targets. â€¢ Collect case studies of the SADC Gender Protocol @ Work. â€¢ Canvass the campaign for an Addendum to the SADC Gender Protocol on gender and climate change. â€¢ Produce 12 issues of the Roadmap to Equality e-newsletter. â€¢ Strengthen institutional mechanisms and partnerships within the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance and with other strategic partners.",2,,,,2/29/12,0,0,0,0,;DFID;Diakonia;Norwegian Church Aid;UN Women,,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,298,100,,DAC,15164,100789,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,7/8/13 12:13,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-Media,Gender and Media,"The proportion of women sources in the news is a key measure of womenâ€™s voice. GL used the Gender and Media Progress Study (GMPS) average of 19% women sources as a baseline for the COE process. After monitoring an additional 30 media houses not in the GMPS sample but that had signed up as COEs, the average remained at 19%. A further analysis of only the COEs put the proportion of women sources in the 108 media COEs at 21% in 2011/2012. In this reporting period, 76 of the 108 media COEs (70%) conducted self-monitoring using a unique on-line tool developed by GL to assess their progress. This the first time ever that such a large number of media houses have monitored the gender-awareness of their own content. GL gathered 25 qualitative case studies of women and men making a difference in the media that forms part of the Changing Lives analysis (Section 9). GL also visited 53 media houses before the SADC Protocol@Work summit to verify the monitoring process and re-administer the GSC to assess progress. The brief highlights of these processes should be read in tandem with GLâ€™s summative report: â€œLearning by listening: Findings of the 2013 Gender and Media Verification.â€ù The 2013 self-monitoring results shows that: â€¢The overall proportion of women sources in GL COEs is 22%, 3% lower than the target of 25%. â€¢However, five out of the ten COE countries â€“Mauritius, Botswana, Madagascar and Malawi- have achieved or nearly achieved the 25% target. â€¢All countries except Tanzania (a drop of 20% to 19%) and the DRC (a drop of 19% to 17%) experienced significant increases in the year under review. The fact that two countries registered a decline affirms the high ethical standards of this self-monitoring process: a research concern but a process bonus as self-monitoring is the best proven way to get media houses to improve practise. A further analysis of the performance of individual media houses shows that 27 of the 76 media houses (one quarter of the 108 COEs) exceeded the 25% target. The examples in the table include the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) that registered a phenomenal 39% increase, in a process that GL and the MBC has documented over time. Capital Radio in Malawi has gone up from 9% to 42% women sources since it joined the COE process, for reasons explained by the stationâ€™s owner and manager: My first encounter with the Gender Links was really embarrassing, since at the time Capital Radio was dominated by men and there were so few women in all departments, they represented only 20%. Gender must be mainstreamed at all levels, we need to move beyond mere representation. Without actually giving women a voice as journalists and sources, the station would not live up to its civic responsibility.â€ù- Al Osman, Capital Radio, Malawi. GL introduced the GSC to measure gender mainstreaming in the media COEs. There are marked improvements in media house performance against key indicators. Overall media houses moved from a baseline score of 57% to 63%. Mauritius made remarkable progress moving from a baseline score of 53% to 80%, a 27-percentage point improvement. The lowest ranking media house in the GSC moved from 39% in 2011/2012 to 47% in 2012/2013. The scores for all media houses are in the Media COE tracking sheet.",2,,6/30/13,,,0,0,0,0,,,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,289,100,,ADT,,519,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,3/26/13 16:58,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-Media,Gender and Media,"Synopsis Gender equality in and through the media captures the essence of GLâ€™s media programme work since the organisationâ€™s formation in 2001. The media programme has remained GLâ€™s flagship programme covering 14 SADC countries. The SADC Protocol on Gender and development has added impetus to the programme, which has continued to grow over the years. This programme brings together media decision-makers, media workers, media trainers, media consumers, and media regulators. The Media Programme works in close collaboration with the Gender and Media Diversity Centre (GMDC). Working with 100 SADC newsrooms, through its Centres of Excellence (COEs) for gender in the media project, this programme is key in transforming gender relations in and through the media. This involves offering media houses a full gender-mainstreaming package that includes on- the- job support and training through a ten-stage process. This process brings together research, advocacy, policy and training sections of the media programme. In 2011, GL reviewed its media interventions to come up with a comprehensive approach that brings together the different components of the programme for more impact. The results of the Glass Ceilings, Women and Men in Southern African Newsrooms Study and the Gender and Media Progress Study (GMPS) sequel to the 2003 baseline study provided vital evidence for the need for a complete overhaul of the project. For example, the GMPS revealed that there had only been a two- percentage point increase in the proportion of women sources from 17% to 19% in the seven years after the Gender and Media Baseline Study (GMBS). The Glass Ceiling Study showed that women constituted less than one third of managers, and less than 5% of top managers in SADC. This showed that the programme needed to go beyond policy development to a more sustained approach that involved capacity building and strengthened M and E systems. Borrowing from the experience in the governance programme, GL sought to work at institutional level, through inviting media houses to sign up as Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media. The media programme also built on the experience of the Media Action Plan (MAP) on HIV and AIDS and Gender that resulted in 80% of newsrooms in the SADC region adopting gender aware policies for addressing the pandemic. Objectives: â€¢ GLâ€™s media programme aims to contribute to the SADC Protocol on Gender and Developmentâ€™s target of gender equality in and through the media by 2015. â€¢ This is through mainstreaming gender in media practice and content. The media has a critical role to play as an agent of change and agenda setter. If properly, harnessed media can influence public opinion. Activities Gender in media regulation The overall objective of this project, which has been running since 2007, has been to provide support to regulatory authorities in developing gender policies, using research and tools developed as part of GLâ€™s policy and research portfolio. The Press Council of Botswana (PCB), which adopted its gender code of ethics in February 2011, has continued with work to ensure full implementation of the code. The regulator has been working to integrate the gender code into the already existing Code of practice. GL has supported PCB on this initiative and a draft-merged code will go before the PCB membership for approval. GL is also in consultation with the new Seychelles Media Council on integrating gender into the councilâ€™s code of ethics. Gender and economic reporting As part of on-going efforts to publicise the economic justice provisions of the SADC Gender Protocol, the media programme, with funding from Diakonia conducted a training workshop for Angolan and Mozambican journalists in Luanda. The workshop coincided with the SADC Heads of States Summit. This workshop served to strengthen the Lusophone Opinion and Commentary Service, launched by the GL Lusophone office in Mozambique in March 2011. GL has distributed the stories written by journalists through the GL service. Media COE project The media COE project is a ten-stage process, which is an expansion of the six-stage gender- policy development process employed under the MAP project and later the gender development process. The new process incorporates capacity building to ensure policy implementation. â€“ DL YOU HAVE THE GRAPHIC FOR MEDIA COE; CAN WE PUT THE LOGO IN THE CENTRE? THANKS? In May 2011, GL brought together the media country facilitators to discuss and review the COE concept. This included reviewing the existing six stages of the policy development process to a ten-stage process. This led to the development of the media COE pamphlet and MOU template. Facilitators agreed on a new handbook Making Every Voice count: Media COE to replace â€˜Diversity in Action: HIV and AIDS Policies in Newsroomsâ€™. The department produced the book in August 2011. Further consultations led to the COE training manual in January 2012. GL has made steady process in rolling out the COE project in the SADC region with 108 media houses and 27 MOUs at the time of writing. As 30 of the newsrooms did not participate in the GMBS, GL undertook baseline studies of these media houses to benchmark progress. Training on covering GBV There have been collaborative efforts between local government and media COES to enhance the organisationâ€™s community reach. In November 2011, media and governance came together to plan for Sixteen Days of Activism on Gender Violence activities as well as linking the media with vital personnel in the communities. This training resulted in media COEs covering the activities of local government COEs. Journalists produced 56 stories on GBV as part of this initiative. Cross cutting issues The SADC Protocol, with its 28 targets on different thematic areas, has been the anchor of GLâ€™s programme work since its adoption in 2008. The media programme has tailored its media training initiatives around these targets, which include a diversity of cross cutting issues. Stage seven â€“ backstopping the work of journalists - covers the following areas: â€¢ Constitutional and legal rights â€¢ Governance â€¢ Education and training â€¢ Productive resources, employment and economic empowerment â€¢ Gender based violence â€¢ Health and HIV and AIDS â€¢ Peace Building â€¢ Media, information and communication â€¢ Implementation Outputs â€¢ Gender inputs into the Draft Code of Conduct for the Botswana Press Council. â€¢ Business Unusual training workshop in Angola: 22 participants; seven stories. â€¢ Media COE handbook and training manual. â€¢ Media Centres of Excellence (COE): 108 centres; 90 gender policies developed and adopted; 28 draft policies; 30 MOUs. â€¢ GBV: 56 GBV stories written. Outreach Working with the media yields a range of multiplier effects. GL views the media both as target - a site for transformation â€“ and as a tool for change. Media practitioners link who go through GL training link into a variety of channels for producing and disseminating gender aware content. Journalists have access to many communication channels of their own through which they yield considerable influence. Their work is affirmed through the Gender and Media Awards, as illustrated in this extract from GLâ€™s â€œChanging Livesâ€ù series: Ripple effects: Story of gender and media activist â€œI was very happy when my commentary piece on the adverse impact of domestic work on girl child education in Tanzania appeared in a special supplement produced by Tanzanian journalists after I had attended a Business Unusual training workshop organised by Gender Links in 2008. At that course, I received my first real practical training on gender and the media. I learned many good things from the training, like the importance of multiple sources. GL CEO Colleen Lowe Morna asked some of participants to go back in the field to ensure that their stories had credible and multiple sources. Eventually GL rewarded our efforts as it got our stories published in a special pull out in the daily newspaper. That was one of the most fulfilling moments of my life. I realised that even though I was a broadcast journalist, I could write for print media. The training helped to boost my personal confidence as well as my professional capacity. Later that year, my vision soared when I won an award for my story: â€œProactive initiatives increased girls university enrolmentâ€ù at the Gender and Media Awards. The award gave me an opportunity to make my first visit to South Africa as well as to meet and establish networks with journalists from SADC region. Back home the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation recognised my achievement on air. Curious colleagues clamoured to write for the GL Opinion and Commentary Service.â€ù -Bestina Magutu, Tanzania Read more on http://www.genderlinks.org.za/article/bestina-mogutu-2012-06-06 The interface with the GL Local Government programme has improved the quantity and quality of Sixteen Day coverage. Through transforming the media, GL ensures that the message of gender equality gets down to communities. Instead of having a Gender and Media Summit in 2012, GL is opting to have one Gender Justice Summit that brings together the local government and media work in 2013, preceded by eight country summits. The intention is to ensure that the various programmes work together to fulfil one of GLâ€™s core mandates: to make every voice count. GLalso works in close collaboration with training institutions that have worked with the organisation on media literacy programmes (see Gender and Media Diversity Centre) that have a wide outreach. GL will work with training institutions on the COE verification process. Outcomes Advancing the SADC Gender Protocol target of gender equality in and through the media: In August 2011, GL conducted further monitoring for media houses participating in the COE project. Whilst the GMPS study gave 19% as the proportion of women sources in SADC news, the additional monitoring showed that the proportion of women sources is now 22%. Women in the media making a difference: GL is in the process of compiling up to date information on newsroom composition to contribute more effectively to the 50/50 campaign within the media. Qualitative evidence suggests that there is a new cadre of bold and assertive media women that are claiming their space as a result of the sustained work on gender and media over the years: â€œGL has done so well in many areas of gender and media work. From the time that I partnered with the organisation, it has helped me grow in many ways and has helped me build confidence within myself, which I proudly apply in my work. It has also helped to have vast networks with many organisations and individuals not only in Zambia but across the world. I have been mentoredâ€ù Perpetual Sichikwenkwe, Journalist and Media Policy Facilitator, Zambia Gender built into policy and practice in media houses: The development of gender policies are significant in the transformation of gender relations in the media as well as creating an enabling environment for gender to flourish. The media programme is moving closer to achieving this target. Poacher turned gamekeeper? The Voice in Botswana Gender Links and The Voice newspaper began their relationship on a volatile note with the publishing of a headline, â€˜Have you had sex with this lady?â€™ back in 2001. Ironically, The Voice would become the first newspaper to launch its gender aware HIV and AIDS newsroom policy back in August 2007. The owner of the newspaper, Beata Kasale, is GLâ€™s Gender and Media Policy Facilitator in Botswana. Over the years, GL has referred to the image and published the controversial headline in its training toolkits and other publications. Yet, as if to prove that from storming comes norming and then performing, the two organisations signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in August 2011 to work together in promoting greater voice and access for women to the mainstream media. The Voice is one of seven media COEâ€™s in Botswana. The relationship between GL and The Voice has been mutually beneficial. GL has conducted capacity-building workshops on a broad spectrum of topics for management and staff at The Voice. These include Sixteen Days of Activism, gender based violence, gender mainstreaming in the media among others. Among other engagements, The Voice, in conjunction with Gender Links, conducted a reader survey both on print and online, mainly run by the online department. The Voice was one of the first media houses in the region to launch its gender aware HIV and AIDS newsroom policy. Developed under the banner of the Media Action Plan (MAP) on HIV and AIDS, this pilot project aimed to work with 80% of newsrooms in the region to develop and implement HIV and AIDS policies. The Voiceâ€™s bold presentation of news has brought the attention the paper to critical issues such as HIV and AIDS. HIV and AIDS remains one of the biggest threats to Botswanaâ€™s economic and social development. The Voice has taken a bold step to bring the subject of HIV and AIDS out for public discussion. As part of implementing its HIV and AIDS policy, The Voice continues to work closely with people living with HIV and AIDS. The COE project will see The Voice personnel go through a ten-stage COE process to develop and implement a gender policy. The policy will cover the whole media house and not just the newsroom. According to Kasale, The Voice staff and management have benefitted immensely from Gender Linksâ€™ gender and media literacy projects and initiatives such as the â€˜Iâ€™ stories. The paper has shared its experiences at Gender and Media Summits including a presentation on the â€œTabloidization of the Mediaâ€ù where the newspaper shared its views based on its experiences as a â€˜tabloidâ€™. The creative tension between GL and the Voice over its â€œpage three girlâ€ù continues. But in its main pages the paper has gone a come a long way in reflecting the daily struggles of women, such as poverty and gender based violence. Challenges So far, GL has relied on workshop evaluations for feedback on effectiveness of the different interventions. Feedback has shown that beneficiaries appreciate the work that GL is doing with them, with most scores in the eighties (see programme report card) except for outputs at 77%. This may be because the COE process is still in its nascent stages. From a low base of 19%, GL has set itself an ambitious target of at 30% women in the media houses that it is working with by 2014. This requires a concerned campaign during the crucial stage seven or backstopping phase of the COE process. Next steps â€¢ In-house monitoring using the self-monitoring tool in August to determine if there has been any progress in women sources. â€¢ High level visits by GL staff and managers to media houses to set targets ahead of the Gender Justice Summits in 2013. â€¢ Tangible evidence of change through the Gender and Media Awards. http://gemcommunity.genderlinks.org.za/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=8572 â€œWell-behaved womenâ€ù seldom make history - or News! By Patricia A. Made â€“ Ideally one page Historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrichâ€™s opening paragraph about â€œwell-behaved women...â€ù in one of her scholarly articles published in 1976 has found its way into popular culture, and still makes one contemplate what women really have to do just to be seen and heard, especially in the media. Zimbabweâ€™s print media landscape over the past two years is a case in point. A flurry of print media â€“ newspapers and magazines â€“ have burst onto the scene, giving a ray of hope that a new range of voices and perspectives, especially the voices of women, and women and men citizens in all walks of life, can find expression on the news events and issues of the day. A good attribute of the Zimbabwean print media landscape is that newspapers are attracting women columnists, as well as offering space for articles on gender equality and womenâ€™s rights and empowerment. One local organisation working on gender equality and womenâ€™s rights in the economic sphere has regular space in a major daily and in a weekly Sunday paper. Editors and journalists are reaching out more to engage with organisations working on gender equality and womenâ€™s empowerment, other than just on the special days when the media needs these organisationâ€™s paid-for advertorials. Many women within the media ranks also are using their columns to write on gender equality and womenâ€™s rights in the Zimbabwean context. And, the public is engaging through Letters to the Editor on the news and issues that carry a â€˜gender tagâ€™. Some of the Zimbabwean media houses also are engaging with the Centres of Excellence in Gender Mainstreaming, a Gender Links pioneering process underway with media houses across the region, to develop, adopt publicly, and put into practice gender editorial and employment policies. As the Zimbabwean media grapples with ways to correct the sexism and gendered silences that permeate media housesâ€™ newsroom and editorial content, one fundamental step is to stay reflective on the age-old journalism questions: â€˜What is news?â€™ And â€˜Who are the news makers?â€™ http://gemcommunity.genderlinks.org.za/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=20486 For example, a story in a major daily on March 30th headlined Females demand 50-50 representation, was national news on the first Gender and Local Government summit held in Zimbabwe organised by GL and the Urban Councils Association of Zimbabwe (UCAZ). But the reasons for why this summit was covered as news illustrate a long-standing struggle with the news media. The Minister of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development and the mayor of Kadoma are the two voices in the news story; the two men are the newsmakers; the tellers of the story of females demanding 50-50 representation. Rigorous reporting and editing would have directed the reporter to the voices and perspectives of the many women and men â€œparticipantsâ€ù who would have contextualized the issues and gave meaning to â€˜whyâ€™ this issue, and the summit, is important for all citizens in Zimbabwe. Every story on gender equality and womenâ€™s rights and empowerment provides the media with the opportunity to â€˜make senseâ€™ of the information and issue for readers. To be fair, the print media also puts the news spotlight more and more on the high-level female top government leaders speaking on a range of issues. But the majority of women who each and every day are making news through their stories of struggle, survival, leadership at community levels and in spaces where the majority of women, and men, still cluster, are still far from the front page news. They are so to speak â€œwell-behaveâ€ù, doing worthy acts that hold communities, homes, families, children and the nation together. If we interpret â€œwell-behaveâ€ù as the ordinary women who live extraordinary lives, then their stories are, and should be, news. Capturing these stories require media that do not just follow trends, but media that return to their roots by re-claiming the principles of public-interest media and journalism, as they weed out and discard the practices (and attitudes) that lead to discrimination and sexism.",2,,3/1/11,,,0,0,0,0,,;UKAID;The Government of Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs - MDG3 Fund,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,298,,,DAC,15164,100521,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,3/26/13 16:53,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-OpinionandComentaryService,The GL Opinion and Commentary Service,"The Opinion and Commentary Service is one of GLâ€™s most innovative projects. Under the banner â€œfresh views on every day newsâ€ù, the service commissions thirty provocative articles on gender issues from activists and opinion shapers around Southern Africa in English, French and Portuguese each month, and markets these to the media. The service attempts to address the findings of the 2010 Gender and Media Progress Study (GMPS), which showed that women's voices are still grossly under-represented in the media, especially in opinion and commentary, and that coverage of gender issues is negligible. It also builds the capacity of journalists to write gender sensitive articles in all areas of development. The service is divided into three: Anglophone (anchored at GL headquarters in Johannesburg); Francophone (anchored in Mauritius); and Lusophone (anchored in Mozambique). This section of the report covers the period March 2011 and February 2012. Anglophone Service The English service published 157 articles; the highest number during Sixteen Days of Activism period. As shown in the Theme Chart below, the highest number of articles is on sustainable development and â€œIâ€ù stories. During the Sixteen Days of Activism, GL published an online newsletter on the gender and climate justice campaign. On average these stories were reproduced almost six times by the mainstream media. This is based on feedback from editors and other direct tracking that GL is able to do using google media search engines and others. In the age of online media, it is difficult to track with any certainty how often stories get used. However, what is evident over the years is that usage of the English service has improved dramatically. This is the direction that the French and Lusaphone services need to be heading. Francophone Service This serves DRC, Madagascar, and Mauritius. The French Service published 96 articles in 2011/ 2012 and of these, 23 were on climate change. On average, the articles were used 2.7 times. The service is now well established in Mauritius, where it has sparked many debates, such as local government and the abortion issue. The service needs greater traction in the other Francophone countries â€“ Madagascar and DRC. The service attracted seven new writers this period. GL has created a separate Francophone list serve and search facility in a bid to grow the service. Lusophone Service takes off The floods in Mozambique early this year gave a much needed impetus to GLâ€™s new Lusophone Service, launched on the organisationâ€™s tenth birthday on 17 March 2012. From 24 to 25 March 2012, GL hosted a Gender and Climate change workshop in Namaacha, Mozambique. The workshop served to introduce journalists to the concept of gender and climate change as well as the Lusophone Opinion and Commentary Service. This workshop organised by Gender Links Lusophone office brought together 24 participants, (ten females and 14 males) representing various Mozambican media houses based in Maputo, and journalism students from Eduardo Mondlane University. The workshop provided a unique opportunity to bring together participants with different views on gender. Challenges â€¢ Cost recovery: As the Service grows in strength it becomes even more apparent that the Service should be able to generate income. â€¢ Writersâ€™ capabilities to write provocative articles. â€¢ Tracking usage. â€¢ Breaking through in Angola. â€¢ Increasing usage of French pieces and getting new writers for the same. Next Steps There is an urgent need to: â€¢ Finalise tracking systems. â€¢ Revise marketing of the service, especially liaising with editors. â€¢ Create templates for French and Portuguese Service articles to be sent out to Lusophone and Francophone list serves. â€¢ Build capacity for writers through giving them feedback, which allows them to improve on the quality of their writing. â€¢ Build GLâ€™s radio networks.",2,,4/1/11,,,0,0,0,0,,;HIVOS;UK AID,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,298,100,,DAC,15164,100542,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,3/26/13 17:26,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-GMDC,Gender and Media Diversity Centre,"Synopsis This report gives an overview of the Gender and Media Diversity Centre (GMDC) during the period 1 March 2011 until 29 February 2012. Our mission statement is to create â€œa more representative, responsive, and professional media as well as citizens, women and men, who are empowered to critically engage with the media.â€ù This vision is achieved through the collection, connection, and dissemination of existing knowledge and resources, as well as collaborating on new research and exchanges. Our target users include trainers; training institutions; media practitioners; academics and researchers; students; gender and media activists; and national, regional and international organisations. Objectives: The Centre aims to: â€¢ Promote more analytical, responsive, and contextual journalism. â€¢ Produce knowledge products in different multi-media formats and popularise them among its target. â€¢ Use new media to communicate GLâ€™s work as well as ignite gender, media, and diversity debates on social media platforms. â€¢ Provide resources that make the links between media theory and practice. â€¢ Build the capacity of citizens, media and journalism students, media, and journalism educators to understand gender and media literacy concepts. â€¢ Develop a culture of critical media production and consumption. â€¢ Offer citizens a platform to discuss pertinent gender issues in society. â€¢ Support and encourage writers to engage with gender issues. â€¢ Publicise the work of media scholars, students and practitioners. â€¢ Develop north-south and institutional partnerships with strategic organisations. Activities and inputs Governance The GMDC advisory group met in May 2011 in Johannesburg. So far, ten institutions and media NGOs have signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Institutions that sign MOUs automatically qualify to become members of the Advisory Group. The rest of the institutions are members of the GMDC. The GMDC also has gender and media activists globally, such as Margaret Gallagher (UK) and Amu Joseph (India) who form part of the international advisory group. During the year under review, the GMDC participated in an initiative led by UNESCO and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) to develop gender indicators for the media. The GMDC also took part in the Africa Media Summit. On 19 September 2011, the Africa Information and Media Summit (AIMS), a meeting that brought together the Pan African Conference on Access to Information, as well as the Highway Africa Conference, adopted the African Platform on Access to Information (APAI) in Cape Town. During the year the GMDC held seminars and online debates on the gender dimensions of access to information, winning at least half of the gains that they sought. Seminars The GMDC continues to provide platforms for citizens to discuss pertinent gender, media and diversity issues. These seminars are in line with the GMDCâ€™s vision to disseminate and create knowledge; connecting people with the relevant information and promoting collaboration that allows citizens to engage. A total of 624 people 62% women and 38% men attended the GMDC seminars. Themes covered included: â€¢ Fifty-fifty debate on women in politics in the DRC, Mauritius and Lesotho. â€¢ Launches of the Gender and Media Progress Study (GMPS) in Swaziland, Tanzania and Mozambique. â€¢ Gender and climate change in Botswana, Swaziland, Mauritius, Zimbabwe and Madagascar. â€¢ Gender, media freedom and Access to Information seminars in DRC; Mauritius; Namibia, Tanzania and South Africa. The Access to Information debates solicited inputs for the draft African Platform on Access to Information (APAI) document submitted to the committee drafting the declaration adopted in September 2011. The GMDC has undertaken a comprehensive audit of the losses and gains in APAI the current issue of the journal, showing that about half the recommendations made it into the document, that otherwise would have been totally gender blind. Below is an example of strong language on gender in the final Declaration: Gender and Media Diversity Journal The Gender and Media Diversity Journal (GMDJ) is the bi-annual journal of the GMDC. The journal provides up-to-date and cutting edge information on media diversity in Southern Africa and beyond. It is a space for the dissemination of research findings and projects; case studies; campaigns; policy developments; and opinion and debate on media practice in the region. Each journal covers latest developments but also focuses on a different thematic area identified in consultation with the GMDC advisory group. GL produced two Journals, Gender, Media, Diversity and Change: Taking Stock and Gender, Popular Culture and Media Freedom, were produced during the 2010/2011 Financial Year. Gender in Media Education http://gemcommunity.genderlinks.org.za/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=24847 The GMDC in partnership with UNESCO has started work on the establishment of Gender Mainstreaming Centres of Excellence in Journalism and Media Education and Training in institutions of higher learning in Southern Africa. The process emerged from the Gender in Media Education Audit. The Audit measured if and how gender is mainstreamed in journalism and media education and training. The research highlighted gaps and good practices in institutions of higher learning across the region. GL is working with institutions of higher learning through sustained interventions that bring together curriculum review and development; policy development; capacity building; specific training in gender and media literacy; e-learning courses for trainers; monitoring and evaluation; and the sharing of good practices at the Gender and Media Summit that happens every two years. Specifically, GL is working in partnership with UNESCO on a project that involves three face to face workshops with journalism and media educators from six Centres of Excellence and Reference. On-line discussions take place in between workshops, through the Community of Practise that has been set up for this purpose. Expected results include: â€¢ Subjects offerings in journalism and media courses that mainstream gender. â€¢ A report on the content and methodology underpinning the training. â€¢ Personal accounts from trainers about the impact of the training and technology on their own learning. â€¢ Courses are publicised and circulated through the COP for other institutions of higher to engage with and utilise. Gender and Media Literacy Training The gender and media literacy course is a GL initiative that is undertaken by the GMDC, aimed at creating a critical citizenry that is able to interpret and make informed judgements as media consumers. Citizens are also empowered to create information and their own media messages. In total, 272 women, and men, 51% women and 49% men benefitted from the gender and media literacy course in 2011 and 2012. The Gender and Media Literacy course utilises the Watching the Watch dogs Gender and Media Literacy Toolkit. The toolkit consists of binder, â€œcoreâ€ù exercises and notes. Each module allows for maximum participation and creativity on the part of learners, as well as adaptation to local circumstances. The binder format allows participants, at whatever level or in whichever location, to add material based on the numerous exercises and assignments. The materials take account of the Outcomes Based approach to Education (OBE). The objective of the media literacy course is to develop a culture of critical media consumption among different target groups. The tool kit draws from research and training material developed over a number of years on gender and the Southern African media. In addition, the course equips participants with gender analysis and a range of communication skills including media monitoring, how to take up complaints, design and cost campaigns, and use new media to leverage these campaigns. Trainers who run gender and media literacy mainstream gender in their courses. The course has been undertaken with citizens, learners, NGOs, women in politics, educators and journalists. GL undertook the course with journalism and media trainers, students and journalists. In addition, through a partnership forged with loveLife, the GMDC footprint is extending into popular culture. Outcomes â€“ the benefits of sustained relations The GMDC has now been in existence for six years, thanks to generous funding from DANIDA and the DFID Governance and Transparency Fund. During that time the GMDC has forged many cross cutting and mutually reinforcing linkages. A comprehensive external evaluation and impact assessment will take place in 2014. As illustrated in the example below of the National University of Lesotho (NUL), there is emerging evidence that the sustained, cross cutting linkages (the GMDC, media literacy, publications and resources, as well as the internship programme) is creating institutional change that cascades to the rest of society through the outreach programmes of such partners. Challenges â€¢ ICT is the glue of the GMDC, yet ICT culture is not yet fully embedded in Southern Africa. Resources gathered by the GMDC are online are not accessible to the majority of its target in SADC. For instance, the media alerts and highlights are an important resource in teaching but usage has been very low despite several trainings with students and trainers to popularise them. â€¢ The ICT sector develops at a fast pace. The Centre has to keep abreast of the ICT developments and use them to the benefit of its target. This may not always be easy. â€¢ Curriculum change in academic institutions in SADC is challenging. Some institutions have not reviewed their curriculum in the past five years because of a lack of financial resources. Men dominate in academic institutions and at times gender issues are met with resistance. â€¢ Signing MOUs has been a challenge because of the bureaucratic nature of academic institutions. Next steps â€¢ Holding a GMDC advisory group meeting in July, in tandem with the next gender and media educators workshop with UNESCO. Inviting gender â€¢ Signing MOUs with all members, and recruiting new members, such as Lovelife as well as gender and media networks. â€¢ Updating the media literacy toolkit â€¢ Planning for the upcoming media literacy training, linked to the Sixteen Days of Activism. â€¢ Mobilising resources for the GMDC. â€¢ Broadening the international contacts and networks of the GMDC.",2,,4/1/11,,,0,0,0,0,,;UK AID;DANIDA,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,298,100,,,,543,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,3/26/13 17:42,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-Governance,Gender and Governance,"The gender and governance programme has grown out of several research and advocacy projects aiming to promote equal representation and effective participation of women in decision-making. The programme stems from a niche identified in local government- the sphere of governance closet to the people yet one under researched. The programme has grown into a regionally recognised programme that brings together GLâ€™s core programme work in holistic ways through the Centres of Excellence for Gender Mainstreaming in Local Government process. The COE approach includes a unique blend of research and evidence, applied to strategies and action planning, with on-the-job capacity building and applied learning, vigorous Monitoring and Evaluation, affirming of good practise, and sharing of learning at the annual summits. Emerging evidence suggests that this is an effective and sustainable model. Action plans are being strengthened through additional content and practise on climate change and sustainable development; care work and local economic development. GL is also strengthening the IT skills of councillors as part of the communications component. For the first time Learning from the first phase has been incorporated in the second phase that has expanded the original six phases to ten phases. GL is on the verge of an exciting new phase â€“ cascading the GBV indicators research to the local level to strengthen 3565 day local action plans to end GBV. Objectives â€¢ Raise support for in-country Gender Justice and Local Government summits held in March each year, starting in 2012. â€¢ Raise support for the roll out of the COEâ€™s to at least half of the 977 councils in the region by 2015, being the deadline for the achievement of the 28 targets of the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development. â€¢ Popularise and enhance application of the SADC Gender Protocol through the village workshops that accompany the COEs and incorporating the Protocol targets into the local action plans. â€¢ Test GBV indicators at the local level and use the findings to measure impact of gender and local government initiatives, as well as build up databases used to gauge the level of gender violence at national level. Activities Following the initial phase of this programme that involved research, national level strategies and district level action plans, GL is now working with 143 local councils directly. GL aims to expand this to 300 by 2014 to cover about one third of the councils in the ten countries. The COE process The COE process has expanded from six to the ten stages shown in the diagram. Key changes include: â€¢ Content of the action plans broadened to include local economic development including care work (the unwaged work of women) and climate change. â€¢ The strategic communications module now has a specific module on IT aimed at ensuring proficiency and capacity building in this area. â€¢ The targets of the planning framework have been aligned to the SADC Protocol on Gender and development. â€¢ Monitoring and evaluation is strengthened through administering scorecards at the beginning and end of the process. GL now proposes to strengthen this even further by monitoring the prevalence and attitudes towards GBV at the beginning an end of the process. The aim is to show that community by community the SADC Gender Protocol target of halving gender violence by 2015 can be achieved. Key principles include: ? Political support: Getting buy-in at decision-making level. ? Evidence-based approach: Conducting situation analysis that is council-specific and helps to address the needs of that council. ? Context specific interventions: Conducting council-specific gender and action plan workshops that localise national and district gender policies and action plans. ? Community mobilisation: SADC Gender Protocol village level workshops that sensatise communities on the provisions of SADC Gender Protocol, empowering them to hold their councils accountable. ? Capacity building: through on-the-job training with council officials and political leaders. ? Application of skills: Assisting councils and communities to apply these new skills through running major campaigns, for example the 365 Days to End Gender Violence; the 50/50 campaign. . ? Monitoring and evaluation: Administration of scorecards and other monitoring and evaluation tools that can be used to measure change in the immediate, medium, and long terms. ? Knowledge creation and dissemination: Working to gather and disseminate best practises, and case studies that are presented at the annual Gender Justice and Local Government Summit and Awards that provide councils and communities with a platform to learn from each other on how to empower women and end violence at the local level. ? Cascading the COEâ€™s: GL is working with local government associations across the region on innovative strategies for cascading the COEs, including working through gender focal points of the associations and peer support. The Gender Justice and Local Government Summits GL broke new ground in 2012 with the hosting of summits in six countries â€“ Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe before the regional summit. This approach greatly expanded the reach and visibility of the work, enabling five times more participants to participate, expanding partnerships and raising the visibility, ownership and impact of the work in-country. Cascading the COEâ€™s within each country There are 977 councils in the ten countries that GL is working in. GL has set a target of reaching half these councils by 2015. GL has canvassed several avenues that for cascading the COEs. These involve working with and through the existing structures of local governments and councils through Training Trainers who would consist of: â€¢ Gender focal points, where these exist, in provincial or district offices of local government associations; â€¢ Gender champions, who have emerged from the first phase of COE work. By having gender champions that function within these councils it becomes possible and also easier to sustain the COE activities and hold partners accountable for ensuring the cascading and ownership of the COE process. From mid 2012, the strategy for cascading the COEâ€™s will be reviewed to include: â€¢ Peer learning amongst councils, both vertically and horizontally, as it is important for councils to be able to learn from each, use each other as resources as well as transferring skills from one council to another in light of the fact that each of the 10 countries are made up of so many councils. Although GL will not be able to reach all of these councils, each council can reach another through peer learning and should be advocating for peer educators to reach the other councils within the countries. â€¢ Twinning arrangements between larger and smaller COEâ€™s. These details are being worked out within each country. GBV indicators at the local level contributing to national surveys GL is seeking funding in-country to run the GBV indicators research in each of the COE localities to strengthen the M and E component. The theory of change being tested here is that by instituting a holistic approach to gender equality at the local level that includes the empowerment of women and changing the attitudes of men, gender violence will deescalate. This is perhaps the most important measure of the success of the COE process. The added advantage is that if the full attitude/prevalence survey is administered in enough communities, this will add up to an overall national GBV prevalence survey. The research thus serves a dual purpose: understanding the specific dynamics at a local level as well as building up a national picture. For a national survey, there are other components of the research methodology that can be added: including media monitoring and political discourse analysis. The flagship tool of the research is, however, the prevalence/attitude survey. In Botswana (see GBV section) the research is being cascaded from national to local by WAD and UN agencies. The table shows that Zimbabwe will be the first country to pilot the GBV indicators from the ground up. Several other countries and UN agencies have shown a keen interest â€“ for example Namibia, Lesotho, Zambia and Swaziland. Seychelles which does not have elected local government at the present time is another keen contender. Outputs â€¢ Completed and launched good quality research reports for Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. â€¢ Completed gender strategies for local government in Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. â€¢ 90 participants (3 countries x 30 participants each) were trained as trainers at the launches and strategy workshops in Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. These women and men are part of gender mainstreaming movement that have identified the need to have gender built into policy, practise at local level, and have committed themselves to ensure that this happens in the councils they work and the communities they service. â€¢ At the time of this report, GL had signed up 143 COEâ€™s; 103 had expressed an interest. â€¢ GL developed a new generic COE Training Manual that is being customised to each country. â€¢ New content on conflict resolution, Local Economic Development (LED), climate change and sustainable development, including HIV/AIDS and Care Work was added to the COE model and training materials â€¢ GL hosted two regional gender justice and local government summits and awards in 2010 and 2011. 2010: 103 award entries; 2011: 124 entries, 86 by women, 38 by men in 8 â€¢ In 2011, winners came from nine countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Outreach Direct With 4605 participants ( 60% women and 40% men) the governance programme has the widest direct reach of all the GL programmes. This is to be expected given the size of the programme, whose indirect reach (population for each of the 143 councils) is 22 milion. Media From March 2011 â€“ February 2012 the Governance programme appeared in the media 89 times. New Media â€¢ Through stage eight of the COE model we empower councils to use the Internet during 16 Days cyber Participants also get an E Mail address, sign up on Facebook and Skype, Twitter and online petitions. â€¢ Our new IT module on the use of mobile technology helps councils understand how they can use a tool that they use daily as an effective campaign tool to push their causes in a cost effective and practical way. Website The Governance website stays current through routine website audits and through by keeping the current COE pages that are innovative and interactive. From March 2011 to February 2012 the programme received 7624 website hits. This is expected to increase since the use of google map to locate all the COEâ€™s on the GL website and put up a report card on each. Publications â€¢ Our new generic COE Training Manual has a CD Rom with country specific examples so that case studies and profiles are contextual and relevant to countries. â€¢ The Mozambique research report GÃ©nero e Governo Local em Mocambique is the most updated gender and local government research in Mozambique. Outcomes Gender and governance is a GL niche. Through working at the local government level, the Governance programme has singularly put gender on the agenda of local government in Southern Africa, and is localising the targets of the Southern African Gender Protocol through the local-level gender action plans. Although most of the countries that GL works in are signatories to the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development, none have put any processes or activities in place to localise the Protocol. Through the citizen scorecard and SADC Protocol Village Level meetings, GL goes to the average citizen and measures their awareness of the Protocol as well as build their capacity around the Protocol. When GL began research on gender and local government, the region had no figures or database on womenâ€™s representation and participation in this critical sphere of governance. Now these figures are known, canvassed, and used for advocacy. Often we receive requests from individuals, organisations, and governments across the region requesting to use or quote our research. GLâ€™s work in Lesotho contributed to the modification and retention of the quota for women in local government in 2011. In Mauritius, GL is credited with the advocacy that led to a quota for women in local government in the 2012 elections, necessitating a constitutional amendment that also makes way for Mauritius to sign the Protocol. Emerging evidence from the COEs shows how these councils are becoming more gender responsive in service delivery. Next steps â€¢ Raise in-county support for the roll out of the COEâ€™s to at least half of the 977 councils in the region by 2015. â€¢ Popularise and enhance application of the SADC Gender Protocol through the village workshops that accompany the COEs and incorporating its targets in the local action plans. â€¢ Test GBV indicators at the local level and use these to measure the impact of gender and local government initiatives, as well as build up data bases that can be used to gauge the level of gender violence at national level.

Ensuring ownership of the process through local associations and key partners. â€¢ Ensure that gender is mainstreamed in local councils, with flagship programmes on gender violence, HIV and AIDS, care work, economic justice, and climate change. â€¢ Develop and maintain local level Monitoring and Evaluation tools used to measure change. â€¢ Gather good practises for the in country and annual regional Gender Justice Summit to be combined wit the media next year.",2,,4/1/11,,,0,0,0,0,;Netherlands Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' MDG3 Fund,;UK AID;Danida,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,298,100,,DAC,15164,100565,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,3/28/13 8:36,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-Justice,Gender Justice,"Synopsis The GL Gender Justice programme comprises of two programmes, the GBV Indicators Research Programme and coordinating a regional Sixteen Days of Activism campaign. Both programme use the 365 National Action Plans (NAP) to End Gender Based Violence as reference point. Inspired by the SADC Protocolâ€™s target of halving levels of GBV by 2015 and the lack of baseline measures of GBV, GL in partnership with local stakeholders has conducted baseline studies using the GBV indicators in the South African Provinces of Gauteng, Western Cape and Kwazulu Natal, Botswana and Mauritius. GL conducted the Gauteng and Mauritius studies from 2010 to 2011 and the Western Cape, Kwazulu Natal and Botswana studies in 2011. The results of the baseline studies are used to strengthen the NAPs. The Sixteen Days of Activism campaign provides an important checkpoint every year to measure the countryâ€™s progress in implementing their NAPs and identifying key priorities for the next year. The campaign is also a time to advocate and lobby for increased activity, budgets and political to address the high levels of GBV. This section of the report will present key activities from the GBV Indicators and Sixteen Days of Activism campaign. Objectives â€¢ To provide baseline information on the extent, effect, response, support and prevention of GBV. â€¢ To lobby Governmentâ€™s and civil society to strengthen NAPs based on the findings of the GBV Indicators studies where available. â€¢ To embark on advocacy campaigns such as the Sixteen Days of Activism to create awareness and hold key stakeholders accountable for strategies and action to end GBV. Background GL with support from UN Trust Fund convened a meeting to assess the progress made in implementing the National Action Plans to End Gender Based Violence (GBV) in the SADC region from the 16-17 February 2011. The meeting brought together representatives from relevant gender ministries and NGOs from the gender violence sectors from 14 SADC countries including Angola, Botswana, the DRC, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The meeting began with a discussion of the global context. At the global level, the UN has taken and called for all countries to develop National Action Plans to End Gender Based Violence. In 2006, the UN Secretary General called on all member states to adopt and implement multi- sector action plans to address violence against women. In 2008 the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign which reiterates the need for a multi-sector approach to ending gender based violence. The campaign is a multi-year effort aimed at preventing and eliminating violence against women and girls in all parts of the world. The May 2010 Southern Africa and Indian Oceans Islands regional launch of the UNiTE campaign and the Gender Based Violence chapter of the SADC Gender Protocol 2010 Progress Barometer show that all fifteen SADC countries have developed some form of action plan to end gender based violence. Gender Links has provided technical assistance in at least ten of these. There is only four years to go before the 2015 deadline to meet extensive GBV targets in the SADC Gender Protocol including the target to reduce current levels of GBV by 50%. There is however no baseline data to measure whether this will be achieved in most Southern countries. Many SADC countries have some form of plan to end GBV. There is a need to critically review the implementation of these Action Plans, with a particular emphasis on the role of the governmentsâ€™ gender machinery in implementation and gain an understanding of support required from different stakeholders to meet the targets set out. SADC states are currently at different levels of implementing National Action Plans to address GBV. Countries may be divided into five categories: â€¢ No plan: no evidence of a coordinated multi-sectoral NAP to end GBV â€¢ Draft plan: a NAP exists but has not been adopted by a relevant government or government department. â€¢ Adopted: NAP has been adopted and launched but a relevant line department within government has not put in place a coordinated implementation strategy with a budget. â€¢ Substantial progress on implementation: the NAP is housed and coordinated by a line Department that has implemented most of the activities in the plan. â€¢ Fully costed and budgeted plans: governments have costed the plan, attached a budget and will be implementing the plan. Activities and inputs GBV Indicators research GL uses a combination of research methodologies to test a comprehensive set of indicators and establish a baseline of GBV in each of the studied areas. The project components are: â€¢ Prevalence and attitudes household survey; â€¢ Analysis of administrative data gathered from the criminal justice system (police, courts), health services, and government-run shelter; â€¢ Qualitative research of menâ€™s experiences of intimate partner violence as well as first-hand accounts of womenâ€™s and menâ€™s experiences, or â€˜Iâ€ù Stories. â€¢ Media monitoring. â€¢ Political discourse analysis. The research uses the different tools to inter-relate and triangulate findings to answer the key questions relating to extent, effect, response, support, and prevention. The flagship tool is the prevalence/ attitude study, justified on the basis that statistics obtained from administrative data do not cover many forms of gender violence, and even those that are covered are under-reported. However, the â€œIâ€ù stories, or lived experiences, give a human face to all aspects of the research. The administrative data, media monitoring and political content analysis provide key insights in relevant areas. 2011 Sixteen days of Activism Local government COEs The primary focus of the 2011 Sixteen Days of Activism Campaign was to ensure that campaigns were extended beyond urban centres to reach communities in the often more remote areas of the region. This was carried out through supporting local councils that have been a part of GLâ€™s centres of excellence (COE) process to undertake Sixteen Days Campaigns. The aim was to include communities within various localities to participate in campaigns. The approach relied upon local councils and communities to plan and facilitate the Sixteen Days campaigns whereas the normal approach is to undertake campaigns on behalf of the localities. Activities included: â€¢ Two day planning meetings to develop comprehensive and specific Sixteen Days action plans and calendars in 23 councils. â€¢ Identifying ten local sources (including survivors) on GBV willing to be interviewed in 7 countries. â€¢ Collating GBV sources into directory of sources - for use by journalists across the region. â€¢ 16 IT for advocacy training workshops to enable 317 members of localities to set up email accounts and enable them to participate in cyber dialogues. â€¢ Documenting personal accounts of GBV survivors in 23 councils. 109 stories documented were on a range of subjects related to GBV. â€¢ 23 Face-to-face discussions on a variety of topics including gender and climate justice. â€¢ Setting up 27 cyber hubs to link in to regional cyber dialogues linking to other councils in the region discussing a range of topics. â€¢ Six citizen action initiatives (marches) for awareness raising and safer spaces in communities â€“ Take back the night march. Training journalists from the media COEs on covering GBV A complimentary focus was to enable journalists and media students to firstly, effectively and creatively cover GBV stories and secondly, to partner with communities and local councils to publicise 16 Days campaigns. Actions to promote local actions to end gender based violence were carried out in 23 councils in 9 countries that were part of the COE process in Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Media training was also undertaken in Tanzania. The purpose of work with the media was to expand and improve the coverage of GBV. In the 2010 Gender and Media Progress Study (GMPS) GL found that only 4% of media coverage in a month of monitoring was on GBV out of a sample of over 30,000 news items from 14 countries. Only 27% of the sources in these stories were women. Men spoke more on all aspects of GBV including rape (75%) and domestic violence (76%). Activities included: â€¢ Three day training workshops with journalists on gender sensitive coverage of GBV in 7 countries. 156 journalists trained. â€¢ Gathering GBV stories in 7 countries and 14 localities. â€¢ Visits to local councils during Sixteen Days to collect stories. 50 Stories collected. Gender and Climate Justice campaign During the 2011 Sixteen days period Southern Africa was host to the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This event held in Durban, South Africa raised issues of justice and human security to the fore at a time when the globe and moreover Africa continues to grapple with critical developmental challenges such as environmental security, sustainable development and climate change. The effects of climate change on vulnerable people such as women and children demonstrate that this phenomenon is clearly a gender justice concern. The two major global campaigns on key justice and development issues came together in late November/ early December 2011. The Sixteen Days of Activism from 25 November to 10 December coincided with the UN Conference on Climate Change in Durban. This gave rise to a dual focus on gender and climate justice in 2011. In addition to localising GBV campaigns, the momentum of the two campaigns was used to launch a concerted campaign for an addendum to the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development on gender and climate change. Though COP17 has come and gone, issues of climate change continue to be addressed through their inclusion in both the local government and media COE process. Activities included: â€¢ Daily Links - a daily E Newsletter disseminated each morning through GLâ€™s and the African Women and Childâ€™s Feature Service (AWC) list serves from 28 November to 9 December on Gender and Climate Justice. â€¢ Main stories housed in the GL Opinion and Commentary Service and the AWC news service and disseminated to: â€¢ GLâ€™s list serve of 11,000 people and the AWC list serve of media outlets in East Africa. â€¢ GL and AWC websites. â€¢ Stories accessible through Facebook and Twitter. â€¢ Distributed to mainstream media â€“ about 100 outlets - in Southern and East Africa for use in newspapers and radio stations. â€¢ 17 cyber dialogues that began with half hour link each day to the Durban conference, followed by the main theme for the day. â€¢ Lobbying and advocating for Addendum to the SADC Gender Protocol on climate change. Targets The envisaged primary beneficiaries of the project are all women and girls. Engaging men in campaigns to end GBV is an important component of the prevention campaign s for GBV. Cross cutting issues Contracting HIV and AIDS is a known effect GBV. This study explores the link between GBV and HIV and AIDS in the studied areas. The findings from South Africa and Botswana show that GBV is a significant precursor to HIV/AIDS. These correlations were difficult to assess in Mauritius where the majority of participants did not know their HIV status because they had never tested for HIV. This project does not directly address climate and environmental issues. However climate change poses potential challenges to women residing in rural communities. These challenges include compromises in food security and in income generation. The limit to womenâ€™s ability to conduct income generating, small and medium enterprise or co-operatives makes them liable to more economic dependence on their partners who may have alternative forms of income. This economic dependence may further expose them to intimate partner violence and limit the options of leaving abusive relationships by the women. However climate change may also be providing opportunities for women to be venturing into new areas of income generation. Projects have been set up ranging from recycling to propagation of drought resistant seed. These offer opportunities previously unknown to women with the promise of reducing their liability to economic dependency and subsequent abuse. Challenges A key challenge of this project is that it is a partnership project with a heavy reliance on political buy in for implementation. The scale and nature of the project requires GL to work with credible partners in each country. This is crucial to ensure that the findings are representative of the context. Political buy-in from inception is also critical for ownership of results advocacy and taking forward the recommendations. The GL partnerships have proven strategic in that they enhance local ownership of the project and pave way for the use of the research findings to inform local policy frameworks and interventions. For example in Botswana, the study is primarily identified as a government study as illustrated in the following excerpt from the Minister of Labour and Home Affairsâ€™ speech at the launch of the research report; â€œWith support from the UN System, my Ministry, in collaboration with Statistics Botswana and Gender Links, a regional NGO, has taken the initiative to conduct this much needed research to establish the prevalence of and attitudes on violence against women and girls.â€ù GL has also used the partnerships to leverage on financial and human resources for the projectâ€™s implementation. For example the Womenâ€™s Affairs Department allocated funds to the tune of about 1.1million Pula for the survey logistical and human resources costs as well as the public launch of the research report. In Gauteng, SALGA Gauteng hosted and covered the full costs of the event. Outputs -Quality data on womenâ€™s experience and menâ€™s perpetration of GBV through survey. Data on use of services by survivors First-hand accounts of GBV experience. Media case studies of GBV coverage. Political speeches -Research reports, pamphlets and commentary pieces -Launch events, presentations of findings in study sites -23 planning workshops with 317 people participating -317 people trained on IT for advocacy -109 first hand accounts -27 cyber hubs set up Reasons for failing to achieve anticipated outputs in this programme area 1. Project inception is dependent on stakeholder consultation processes to obtain political buy in. This has often delayed implementation. 2. Access to administrative data requires GL to request and then wait until mostly more senior officers give clearance. This has been a challenge and has delayed the implementation of the administrative data component and affected the project as a whole. 3. The collection of first-hand accounts of violence requires GL to partner with support organisations. The turnover time for signing of MOUs by the partners has posed delays. Another challenge is the access to a critical mass of survivors who are willing to tell their stories. 4. Human resources capacity has posed an impediment to progress. Project manager is contributing most of the content work in addition to the managerial tasks. The Mauritius report is still outstanding because the process of findings validation is now dependant on the availability of the Prime Minister. Adjusting milestones The target to complete KZN and Western Cape Reports will have to be moved into the 2012-2013 work plan because GL still awaits the administrative data from the two provinces and an organisation to partner with in the collection of I stories in Kwazulu Natal. The remaining time in this year will be dedicated to finalising and validating the Mauritius report. Outreach How do you ensure a cascading effect in your work through; please give examples GL uses different platforms to ensure a cascading effect in this work including the media, social networks, the GL website and strategic distribution of publications. For each new publication, the editor sends press releases and opinion pieces based on the results through the GL list-serve. The media pick and use the commentaries. For example the SABC news, Daily News, News 24, Rutgers and ICTJ News republished the commentary piece entitled â€œpolice statistics still fall shortâ€ù which recommends the use of survey methods for collecting GBV data as opposed to relying on police data. Women 24, SABC News, Iq4 News and Cape Times republished the commentary piece entitled â€œPolice statistics still do not include domestic violenceâ€ù which called for the South African police to honour their commitment to include domestic violence statistics in the annual crime reports following the recommendations of the Gauteng study. All Africa, Mopane Tree, Silo Breaker, Africa Focus, I4u & African news wire republished the commentary titled â€œState of Emergency call to end violence against womenâ€ù which calls for action to address the high prevalence of GBV shown by the Botswana study. GL is using social networks for example the Enough is Enough Facebook page which was created following the outcomes of the Gauteng research. The page is a campaign initiative aimed to promote activism against GBV. To date more than 11,000 people â€˜likeâ€™ this pa ge. For each new publication, the web administrator puts up an e-announcement on the website. The Botswana and Gauteng reports are available on the GL website. Project staff compiles the results from each study site into reader friendly research reports. GL launches the event at well publicised events attended by relevant stakeholders. GL also strategically distributes the publications to national and regional stakeholders.

In a video address to the SADC Protocol@Work Regional Summit , Malawi President Joyce Banda, committed to ensuring that Malawi ratifies the SGP before the August Heads of State Summit to be hosted by Malawi. During the SADC Protocol@Work summit, high level delegations from Botswana and Mauritius, the only two countries that have not signed the Protocol, pledged to make a concerted effort to do so. The Alliance has lobbying strategies for both countries. The SGDI, a measure of progress by the 15 countries against 23 indicators in six sectors (education, political participation, the economy, health, HIV and AIDS, and the media) for which empirical data is available moved from 66% to 67% (1% lower than target). Major achievements include the adoption of a quota for women in local government in Mauritius (see Outcome 3); the new Constitution in Zimbabwe that incorporates 75% of womenâ€™s demands ; reductions in maternal mortality and access to PMTCT. There is progress towards giving women greater voice in the media (see Outcome 2) but the region is still far from achieving its goals of gender parity in politics, the media and the economy; and of halving GBV by 2015. However, one of the most significant contributions of the SGP has been to provide a tool for citizens to demand accountability. Through the SGPA, all three GL programmes working together, the energy and muscle of the 300 media and local government COEâ€™s coming together in 12 national and a regional summit in the first quarter of 2013, GL has managed to gather substantially more case studies of the SADC Protocol@Work than target. An analysis of the 672 case studies gathered in 2012/2013 shows that the provisions of the Protocol most referred to correlate closely to GLâ€™s programmes â€“ media, GBV, productive resources and governance. This affirms GLâ€™s efforts to move from paper provisions to changing lives in its own work. The constitutional and legal rights provisions also feature strongly, thanks to strong SGPA networks in this area. However, the SGPA needs to work harder in the education, HIV and AIDS, health and peace building sectors, as well as building advocacy networks in countries like Angola and Seychelles, that did not host summits or submit entries. GL has strengthened the SGPA network through identifying country focal networks in all countries, including the five countries where GL does not have offices . The fact that three of these â€“ DRC, Tanzania and Malawi- hosted successful summits in March 2013 is an indicator of country networkâ€™s taking greater ownership. VSO Regional Aids Initiative Southern Africa (VSO RAISA) has not formally signed an MOU due to internal processes to lead on care work but has been an active member of the network. GL has made headway on MOUâ€™s with the menâ€™s sector and FBOs (see additional information). The campaign for an Addendum on Gender and Climate Change gained momentum with an online petition signed by 1027 citizens (55% men; 45% women) , and gender ministers formally backing this proposal. The SGPA is now preparing to take advantage of the HOS in Malawi, hosted by the regionâ€™s only woman leader to make the case for reopening the SGP. The campaign is an example of gender activists pushing the envelope through their insistence that the SGP be a responsive, â€œlivingâ€ù instrument.",2,,,,6/30/13,0,0,0,0,,,;Gender Links,,,,,Southern Africa,289,100,,ADT,,791,Gender Links,finance@genderlinks.org.za,en,ZAR,7/8/13 12:24,GENDER LINKS,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08,23,ZA-CIPC-2001/005850/08-OpinionandCommentaryService,The GL Opinion and Commentary Service,"This year the focus will be on climate change as GL and the SGPA push for an Addendum on Gender and Climate to the SGP. GL will ensure close synergies with the Opinion and Commentary Service (OCS). The Lusophone service has demonstrated how the media COEâ€™s and OCS can work together through taking journalists on a field visit to cover the effects of mounting floods as result of climate change. These 15 stories, read 591 times on the website, generated debates on the effect of climate change on traditional medicine and subsistence agriculture.

The current local government COEâ€™s reach approximately 28,887,004 people in the SADC region, 21.3% of the population in these countries. After narrowing down this measure to the COEâ€™s that GL works with to ensure more accurate attribution, a key finding is that women in the COE councils constitute 28% of the total: six percentage points higher than the regional average of 22%. However, the figure is two percentage points below the 2013 PPA target of 30% for COEâ€™s that GL works with. The difference is largely due to the Mauritian local government election held in November 2013 in which GL in credited with successfully advocating for the gender neutral quota that led to an increase in womenâ€™s representation from 6.4% to 26.2%. All the municipal and district councils in Mauritius are local government COEs. GL Mauritius went beyond advocating for the quota by seeking out women candidates and training them for office. To ensure that this success goes beyond numbers and translates into gender responsive governance, GL is cascading the COE process to 55 villages. â€œLocal government ministries and authorities will collaborate and champion gender equality and mainstreaming at national and local level as well as provide human and material support for doing so.â€ù - Hon.

'Citizens are moving away from such blatant stereotypes towards a more affirming position that women make a difference in politics by voting for them.' Cehl Meeah, Member of Parliament and leader of the Mauritian Solidarity Front (FSM). The local government Gender Score Card (GSC) measures gender responsiveness in councils. The GSC includes 25 questions that cover five key areas: the gender policy framework, governance, mainstreaming gender into existing programmes, gender specific programmes and employment practices and environment. It is a participatory tool in which beneficiaries assess themselves with independent verification by GL during visits and finally by summit judges. Overall, the 124 councils verified in early 2013 scored 63%, eight percentage points higher than their baseline score of 55% in 2012. South African COEs scored highest (75%) while Lesotho made the most progress (20%). Every country except Swaziland (a traditional monarchy, where the score dropped from 58% to 54%) made progress. The Learning through listening: Findings of the 2013 Gender and Local government COE verification analyses the successes, challenges, strategies and next steps. Budget allocation to gender work by COEâ€™s compared to donor contributions The budget allocations cover a variety of areas including: â€¢Towards the councils participation in the SADC Gender Protocol Summit. â€¢For the implementation of the gender action plan. â€¢Logistical costs for COE workshops. â€¢Specific campaigns such as the 16 Days of No Violence Against Women A key VFM finding of the verification analysis (see table above) and indicator of the success of the programme is that Councils now allocate twice what GL has spent on the COE process (6.5 times the PPA spend) for taking forward gender work. Capricorn District Municipality in South Africa (the best performer in the 2012 and 2013 summits) allocated GBP 33 000 towards improving gender mainstreaming in service delivery. Ownership, capacity and performance are also being enhanced through training Drivers of Change: â€œI first interacted with Gender Links when they came to train us in Maseru on gender mainstreaming. Now I am one of the trainers for the council. In my work as a councillor, I ensure that there is supply of water for the community and that broken taps are maintained. As a council, we also issue licenses for small dams. We educate people to become aware of climate change.

GL initiated the GBV Indicators research in partnership with government, local government and civil society partners in Botswana, Mauritius and South Africa. GL completed the research in the South African Provinces of Limpopo, Western Cape and Kwa Zulu Natal (Target for Year 1) and cascaded the research to three additional countries (Target for Year 3), Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia. All the elements of the research are complete in Zimbabwe and in process in Lesotho and Zambia. GL presented the findings of the research to date at a forum of African Gender Ministers convened by UNECA at the CSW, GL has been asked to join a UNECA reference group designing a study on the costs of GBV, an area that requires further exploration in the research. GL envisaged that the research would unfold in a linear way. The plan was to do the research in South Africa, Mauritius and Botswana followed by advocacy and lobbying. The envisaged result was a GBV National Action Plan that incorporated the indicators and baseline data in the three countries. Two factors affected the original plan: the burgeoning interest in conducting the baseline study in several SADC countries and the need to work with governments at their pace in a way that ensures ownership and muscle for the follow-up processes. In addition to the three countries where GL has moved ahead thanks to PPA flexible funds and accompanying grants from Sida, UNWOMEN and the UNDP, Namibia, Mozambique, Seychelles and Malawi have expressed interest in undertaking the research. With regard to the follow up processes in the countries where the research has been launched, an important first step has been to elevate political buy in and support. This has been most successful in Botswana and Mauritius. â€œIn Botswana, the (VAW Baseline Study) findings have sparked an unprecedented engagementâ€_ The results provided a springboard for a countrywide drive to address GBV. Cabinet sent the Women's Affairs Department back to the drawing board to come up with baseline data for every district beyond the 'narrow statistical sample' to better understand the dynamics in each locality. The President of Botswana (Ian Khama) has tasked everyone in the country to map the response that each current and prospective stakeholder would undertake as part of a multi-sector approach to address GBV as a response to the findings.â€ù Valencia Mogegeh, Director, Womenâ€™s Affairs Division, Botswana. Four ministers, the head of the Equal Opportunities Commission and an editor in chief of a major newspaper attended the launch of the Mauritian report, that has since been the subject of a cabinet memorandum.

MBC radio linked in with a one hour talk show. The report received extensive coverage in the mainstream media. The stage is now set for reviewing the existing National Action Plan on Gender. South Africa is more complex. GL had hoped that its membership of the National GBV Council would leverage support for cascading the research to the whole country, but this structure has been slow to get off the ground. GL has followed the parallel strategy of presenting the research to provincial governments (for example to the executive committee of Gauteng province, chaired by the Premier) and canvassing the Commission on Gender Equality (a Constitutional body) to use its muscle to get government support for the roll out.

Targeting projects across developing and emerging economies, it aims to deliver greenhouse gas emissions savings and support local development. GCPF was established by the German Government (BMU) and development agency (KfW) and has been operating successfully since 2011 and is open ended with no set close date. GCPF is a Fund that is commercially run by Deutsche Bank. The majority (at least 70%) of the Fund will be used to provide local financial institutions with credit lines, with which they in turn offer market rate loans to SMEs/households for renewable energy or energy efficiency projects. A smaller part of the Fund, up to 30%, will make direct investments (equity or debt) in similar projects. GCPF has a complementary technical assistance facility for local financial institutions to introduce or enhance innovative climate change oriented loan products to facilitate new and protect existing investments of the Fund. The private sector (both local financial institutions and the wider capital markets) has a lack of experience and hence confidence in providing finance for small-scale renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. This means that appropriate finance is either not available to SMEs and households, or that lending is offered at prohibitively expensive rates to compensate the high risk that is perceived due to lack of experience of this type of lending.

The proposed project fully contributes towards MDG 1b, â€˜Achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young peopleâ€™ by increasing the capacity of workers in the informal economy to escape from poverty and better manage risks and shocks. In many of the poorest, most geographically isolated hill and mountain regions of Nepal, residents rely on â€œself-help groupsâ€ù known as Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) for support. VSLAs help marginalised households to access information, peer support and services, as well as creating group-based savings and loan funds, which can then be used as insurance, working capital for self-employment activities, emergency funds, and savings. An estimated 300,000 of these informal VSLAs exist in Nepal, but they often suffer from poor governance and embezzlement and end up failing to carry out the role for which they were created. As a result, many Nepali people often depend heavily on high-risk informal loans to cover consumption and emergency needs, with many families taking annual loans averaging Â£350 at interest rates exceeding 60% per annum. Many are unable to repay these loans in cash, and therefore often make repayments with crops or take out a second or third loan to repay the first loan, resulting in a cycle of debt from which it is almost impossible to emerge. Facilitating access to formal Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) for informal VSLAs therefore serves as in important intermediary step that allows vulnerable groups to benefit from formal financial services, technical services, and social protection mechanisms. However, to expand access to such formal SACCOs effectively, qualified intermediary organisations like NEFSCUN must be capable of forming and expanding their networks while at the same time enforcing minimum standards of governance and extending legal protection. Whilst NEFSCUNâ€™s activities have proven effective the organisation has yet to reach some of Nepalâ€™s poorest and most underserved districts due to remoteness and the costliness of operating in these areas. Furthermore, given that their Cooperative Development Process remains costly to implement and is not outreach-based, the reach of their network remains constrained. As such, Mercy Corps and NEFSCUN will partner to develop a cost-effective, outreach-based model to reach the vast array of informal, community-based VSLAs already in existence.",2,,,5/31/14,,0,0,297009.72,0,,,,;NEPAL FEDERATION OF SAVINGS AND CREDIT COOPERATIVE UNIONS (NEFSCUN),,NP,,,,,"ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - FINANCIAL SERVICES, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT",,24030,222,MERCY CORPS SCOTLAND,gfarmer@uk.mercycorps.org,en,GBP,11/19/14 4:32,MERCY CORPS SCOTLAND,GB-SC-SC030289,21,GB-SC-SC030289-90908,INCREASING FOOD AND WATER SECURITY IN NANA MAMBERE,"Output 1: Rural and peri-urban populations in the intervention areas benefit from increased access to a safe water supply and basic sanitation services.

Indeed, in a country where productivity is considered as a crucial factor of social recognition, the project will help women and men with disabilities and/or their families, through economic activity, to take control over their life, to gain self confidence and to get a chance to actively participate into both family and community life and decision making. At community level, the project intends to change perceptions on the socioeconomic potential of persons with disabilities and to support disability inclusion into both service provision and local government management (24 communes). In line with legal provisions and policies promoting equal access and representation, existing both in Cambodia (Law on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted in July 2009 and National Plan of Actions for Persons with Disabilities adopted in November 2008) and at international level (UNCRPD signed by the Royal Government of Cambodia in 2007, ratification actions currently in process) Support to 18 local service providers will permit to remove existing barriers for long term-benefit and to provide, on a short-term basis, services to 400 men and women with disabilities and/or families living with disability (M:200, F:200) as described in 3.4.

The aim of DNH is to help assistance workers understand and deal with the complexities of providing assistance with better outcomes for the societies where assistance is provided. Why â€œConflict Sensitivityâ€ù and Do No Harm? First, it is our responsibility. If our aim is to help people, then we must avoid causing harm to them. Second, it leads to more effective programming. Having a better understanding of and relationship with a community makes everything better and easier, from planning and design through implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Third, it is cheaper. It is far less costly to prevent or avoid conflict than to deal with its impacts later. Conflict destroys what we have built physically and socially and sets back the communities and our efforts. Do No Harm Analysis.

Moreover, the majority of freed Kamaiyaâ€™s are illiterate and possess, because of their socio-economic history, few livelihood skills and economic knowledge. In fact many freed Kamaiyaâ€™s, particularly men, see no other way to make a living in freedom than by selling their unskilled labour in away-from-home places, supporting their left-behind families through financial transmittances whenever possible. Despite good intentions these transmittances are generally too low for a family to sustain, and many heads of households, mostly women, have assumed the responsibility to make a living on their own. This action focuses on particularly the capacity of female headed freed Kamaiyaâ€™s households in Bardiya district to establish a decent standard of living for their families, particularly children.

The district recieves less rainfall but also is prone to floods during the rainy season hence the area is characterized among others by food insecurity, environmental degradation, and low household income. Women in the district are often marginalized in social and economic spheres despite that they play a key role in securing food and are in general the backbone of socio-economic activities. The project is addressing challenges of food insecurity, high illiteracy rates, environmental degradation, low household income levels to reduce vulnerability of people. For example Mrs Donata Jenifa Light of Mtondo club in Mwasiya II Village from Traditional Authority Maseya in Chikhwawa District said the project has brought viable solutions to their socio-economic problems .' 'We were experiencing a lot of problems before the project including poor harvest, but now we have learnt conservation farming which has improved the crop production. We have learnt conservation agriculture, construction of firewood stoves, group management and dynamics and business management.' The training has also improved the self-esteem among the women farmers who have acquired knowledge in how to increase their production and income. ;This project is fundamentally about capacity building and empowerment. The project is building capacity of women farmers which is contributing to the achievement of purpose and outputs in the following ways: 1) The women groups will be trained in improved agriculture techniques. This will be conducted by the Farming Instructors through out the project period. The Farming Instructors have all been part of similar program and are well trained in the subject matter. The training will both give the women farmers solid back ground knowledge and hands on training in the demonstration gardens . Included in the training will be courses in basic business management. Each beneficiary will be encouraged to start a small business to supplement family income. 2) The women farmers will also be trained in what it means to be food secured and the concept of a balanced diet. 3) The capacity to work together as a group to achieve one goal will also be built among the target beneficiaries via organizational structure, In the 2nd project year min 2 cooperatives will be established and run by the women farmers them selves. Around 50% of the women farmers will be in each. In each cooperative processing plants for soy beans, ground nuts and pulses, vegetables and fruits will be established to increase the value for crops they will be growing. 4) The women farmers will be in installing sealed rope and washer pumps to increase access to drinking water and water for irrigation. The women farmers will also be trained in irrigation and they will establish each an irrigated garden for vegetable production not depending on the rains. This production will both increase the cash income and the nutrition level of the household .5) the participating women farmers will furthermore advocate for the applicability of other project activities to other members who are their neighbours. For example the use of potholing method for planting maize which is more essential in areas with low rainfall which will advocated for in the target area. Campaigns on healing the environment will be introduced in the entire community and programs will be ongoing to ensure that everyone take part and contribute. ;The project main target are 5250 women in Chikhwawa district, Malawi. The project is promoting equity and empowerment because they underpin poverty reduction and are also important in creating enabling environments for poverty reduction among female farmers to increase their access to opportunities for sustainable livelihood. The project has established women farmers clubs through which necessary skills are being imparted to women in leadership and agriculture production to empower them to take leading role in their households as well as community level. There also interaction activities between direct and indirect beneficiaries so that community members should visualize the potentials of women in leading development at household level which has enabled community members to appreciate the need to involve women in various activities at household and community level in order to improve their livelihoods. Women are also participating in agriculture marketing and income generation activities to foster pro-poor growth because economic empowerment of women is critical in empowerment of marginalized groups in the district as women are often denied opportunities due to social and cultural norms.

The impact of the project will be to see a community which is food secured and which is capable to creating wealth through empowering women to take leading roles in the fight against poverty and hunger. This will be through intensive training leading to: increased food production for own consumption as well for sales increased engagement in animal husbandry, increased level of literacy, of capacity to plan and budget for the agriculture production and the family economy, improved health and greater gender equality at household level and in the wider community.;Overall the fundamental approach of the project is to train and equip the participating farmers to be able to carry on and further what they have achieved during the project period within the framework of the structures & organisation of the Clubs, cooperatives and associations - as well as the government structures of extension services. The project fosters: 1) sustainable empowerment of women which remains with each individual and enable each individual and the Clubs to excel and develop further - which after completion of the project will be hand in hand with existing structures. 2) Institutional sustainability by organizing the women farmers and creating ownership of these structures amongst the farmers them selves. 3) Financial sustainability: The farmers will learn how to multiply seeds and cuttings and how to make natural fertilizers to ensure that they have access to these inputs from their own resources. The farmers will learn planning and budgeting to cater for their ongoing production. A part of the Exit Strategy will be that beneficiaries under supervision of Farming Instructors will find their own inputs for the last growing season in the project. The exposure of the results achieved using this program model via field visits by current and potential donors, via the public statements from MoAFS on the its potential attention is drawn to this program which will result in funding towards upscale in the areas of most need. ;The primary target groups is 5250 women farmers. Women were selected as a group because of the disproportionate impact that poverty has on women in all its forms, whether social, political, physical or economic. Women work longer hours, earn less, receive less education, are subject to high levels of domestic violence, are more at risk from HIV and have limited access to resources and decision making. They face discrimination in inheritance and divorce settlements â€“ a cause of increased vulnerability of women headed households. In terms of employment men have the advantage to go anywhere and work while women are predesigned by culture that they are to remain at home and take care of children. To achieving MDG 3 requires a change for women. Gender disparities among in the target communities is still rampant The Sena tribe always put a man first in everything and it is one of the culture barriers which we seek to address in this project. From the Chikhwawa Social economic profile other examples supports this: In 2007 twice as many men applied fertilizer than women apparently due to easier access to markets and centers of distribution.* and subsequently got a better yield. From the same source 3 to 4 times as many males hold paid work as compared to women. The project will both empower the women farmers via the program as well as include men in the process for them both to appreciate and respect the potential of the women and for both parties work together towards the needed changes in traditions and behaviors leading to the gender inequalities.",2,,8/1/12,,,0,0,0,0,;Department For International Development (DFID),,,;Development Aid from People to People (DAPP) Malawi,Recipient Country where the project is being implemented,MW,100,,,,The project aims to empower women as well as enhance their livelihood security,ADT,,100928,Digital Campus,alex@digital-campus.org,en,GBP,1/6/15 17:17,Digital Campus,GB-COH-07629751,80,GB-COH-07629751-gpaf-inn-026,"Improving Health Extension Workersâ€™ training and effectiveness through continuous skills improvement, knowledge assessment and patient management processes for 160 Ethiopian health workers","We aim to increase the on-going, practical application of primary care skills of Community Health Workers gained during and following training programmes to help improve levels of assisted births and post natal care.

However in the DRC, the vast majority of those accused are placed in pre-trial detention, they do not regularly appear before a judge, and they do not have access to a lawyer. Moreover, their humanitarian situation while in prison is appalling, principally as a result of extreme prison overcrowding and the almost total absence of any commitment on the part of the Congolese government to providing basic services (food and sanitation). Very often, prison conditions constitute â€œinhumane and degrading treatmentâ€ù. The overcrowding in Congolese prisons is, in large part, due to the high number of illegal pre-trial detentions. ASFâ€™s experience of the Congolese justice system over more than 10 years confirms that there is a correlation between the massive scale of illegal pre-trial detentions and the absence of systematic, quality legal aid. The issue, therefore, is to offer a lasting, structural response to the issue of mass illegal pretrial detentions, which is symbolic of all the problems of the Congolese justice system. This response would be introduced alongside existing programmes supporting justice reform in the DRC. ASFâ€™s intervention strategy involves firstly implementing a human rights approach based on the principle of the interdependence of human rights as a precondition of their effectiveness. To reinforce the classic approach of arranging quality legal aid for the highest number of pretrial detainees (right to a fair trial, access to a judge), this pilot project, for the first time in the DRC, allows the principle of the interdependence of human rights to be put into action by incorporating violations of detaineesâ€™ economic and social rights and a new aspect â€“ access to justice as a factor in reducing poverty â€“ to be promoted. In fact, the social and economic impact of depriving individuals of their liberty is often underestimated. The detainees and their families often live in extreme poverty and thus for them, access to a quality justice system is not a priority. This is a vicious circle, reinforcing the dynamics of impoverishment. Access to justice therefore becomes even more difficult. And the situation is clearly even worse in cases where the detention is illegal. Therefore, it is imperative that the individual and also the collective consequences of PD are taken into account, not only by political decision makers, but also by all of those responsible for individual legal proceedings (lawyers and magistrates). ASFâ€™s project aims to raise awareness, provide information and take action alongside numerous local, national and international players from the legal and university sectors, as well as the anti-poverty sector, to highlight the consequences, both individual and collective, of pre-trial detention and to develop effective long- and short-term strategies to reduce its most harmful effects. In order to make a contribution to strengthening the rule of law in the DRC through combating mass illegal pre-trial detentions, ASFâ€™s intervention strategy involves guaranteeing access to systematic and quality justice for vulnerable individuals held in pre-trial detention in the three provinces covered by the project (Kinshasa, Equateur and Bas Congo), as well as developing a national strategy coordinated by the National Order of Lawyers of the DRC (ONARDC). The aim is to achieve the following results: - Result 1: Pre-trial detainees are made aware and informed of their right to a fair trial and their right to food, and of the mechanisms of recourse available to obtain them. - Result 2: Pre-trial detainees benefit in the long term from quality, systematic and ongoing legal aid. - Result 3: Those involved in providing access to justice are aware of detaineesâ€™ right to food and the corollary between A2J and poverty reduction In order to achieve these results, a series of initiatives will be implemented: - awareness raising and information for detainees, an essential step in the change process so that detainees can decide to take legal action to contest the legality of their situation - awareness raising and information for those working in the justice sector (magistrates, lawyers, civil society, the Ministry), the university sector and the development sector on the individual and collective consequences of PD and on the â€˜legalâ€™ actions which can be taken to reduce the most harmful effects - providing quality legal assistance to hundreds of pre-trial detainees, with priority given to women and minors - building the internal capacity of the ONARDC and the four relevant bar associations (Kinshasa Gombe; Kinshasa Matete; Matadi; Mbandaka) to put in place and manage a systematic and quality legal aid service for pre-trial detainees, notably through the establishment of a Pre-Trial Detention National Commission for Legal Assistance - improving the technical skills of lawyers to take responsibility for this legal aid, through training, coaching sessions and the publication of teaching materials - strategic litigation to support â€˜high value addedâ€™ judicial proceedings, establishing through the legal process the responsibility of the Congolese state with respect to international law on human rights and the rights of detainees. Expected Impact This two-year project paves the way for a multi-year strategy aimed at gradual disengagement from the provision of direct services in favour of the local bar associations, acting under the aegis of the National Order of Lawyers of DRC (ONARDC) and recognition of this organisation, at a national level, as the primary interlocutor with the state in the legal aid sector benefitting, firstly, those who have been deprived of their liberty. At a local level, the project will help lawyers to specialise and give responsibility to the authorities of each bar association for putting in place lasting local mechanisms for providing legal aid to detainees. In addition, the project will mobilise new players â€“ the University of Kinshasa and some of its law students â€“ to set up a legal clinic in the capitalâ€™s prison. This work has a long-term aspect to the extent that these students are aspiring to commence their professional lives in the â€˜legal services marketâ€™ and, in the near future, to get involved in developing national policies, in other words in the administration of justice within their country. Thus, they will receive training on the issue of access to justice for the most vulnerable and on the tools which can be used to protect the rights of individuals, which they will then be able to continue to promote and implement.;The direct beneficiaries of the project are the pre-trial detainees incarcerated in the three prisons in the project areas (Kinshasa, Matadi and Mbandaka) and also, given the synergies between programmes at a national level, prisons in the East, where ASF is implementing a similar approach as part of the Uhaki Safi project. The indirect beneficiaries of the project are, firstly, lawyers: the National Order of Lawyers of the DRC (ONARDC) and their respective bar associations (Matete and Gombe of Kinshasa; Matete and Mbandaka). For the first time as part of this type of approach, the project will also involve students from the University of Kinshasa who will be trained and supervised to run legal clinics at Makala prison. Finally, the Congolese population as a whole will benefit from the impact of a project which will contribute to establishing the rule of law in the DRC as part of an approach where access to fair, quality justice can also make a significant contribution to fighting poverty.;General objective: to contribute to consolidating the rule of law in the DRC through combating mass illegal pre-trial detentions.

At the end of last June, there were 6,397 asylum seekers and 44,034 refugees in the country. Although the capacity of the authorities to protect these populations remains limited, the protective environment itself is rather favourable to such protection. First of all, the legislative framework guarantees a process of admission observing certain security conditions, the prohibition of forcible returns and that the norms regulating their treatment are respectful of the rights of refugees. Burundi has ratified the instruments that are central to the regime of international protection of refugees: the Geneva Convention 1951 and its Additional Protocol from 1967, as well as the OAU Convention regulating aspects that are specific to the problems of refugees in Africa and which the asylum seekers can rely on to claim a wider definition of International Protection. As an exceptional regional measure, the protection instruments have been integrated into national legislation. The Burundian judicial arsenal has established the principle of non-refoulement and guarantees the application of the rights to work and education, and access to identity documents. The law establishes ONPRA (National Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons) as the current body to manage asylum, to elaborate new plans of action, to liaise with the HCR, the border police and provincial authorities and to coordinate the aid and protection interventions in the camps. Finally it guarantees the right to legal counsel for asylum seekers during the refugee status determination procedure and organises legal representation in case of refusal at first instance. Despite this legal arsenal, asylum seekers have limited access to asylum procedures, due to the unavailability of free assistance services and a lack of knowledge of the law and procedures. Confronted to linguistic, bureaucratic and procedural barriers they do not benefit of any support in obtaining individual documents and civil status documents, which are precisely required to prove their nationality and access the personal status of refugee. Some are denied the status at first instance because of a lack of legal support. In the absence of available or adequate legal representation, their requests for appeal fail before the appeals committee. Also the insufficient protection and lack of legal assistance for refugees shows that obtaining the refugee status does not automatically allow for the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the Geneva Convention or national legislation. Active in Burundi since 1999, ASF is implementing since January 2012 a project of international protection of the rights of asylum seekers and refugees (PIDDAR), with the objective of Â« reinforcing the measures of protection and assistance for refugees and asylum seekers and to promote asylum and the international protection of refugees in Burundi Â». The intervention strategy focuses on the respect of equitable procedures for the determination of the refugee status but also on improving legal aid and advice for refugees and asylum seekers, as well as individuals amongst that group who are victims of sexual violence. The project comes to support the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and the National Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (ONPRA), a technical structure set up by the Burundian Minister of State to determine the refugee status. Activities: 1. Reception, guidance and legal assistance - The PIDDAR project provides legal advice for asylum seekers throughout all phases of the procedure. The advice is given in any area related to asylum law, procedure and refugees rights. The centres will provide various services such as greeting, informing and guiding asylum seekers or refugees confronted to problems of law (violations of the right to health, etc.). Questions that do not concern the areas of intervention mentioned above are referred to the available services (IRC, HI, etc.) - The legal services of the project will greet refugees and asylum seekers who need legal assistance for any question related to the asylum procedure, protection documents, civil status documents, etc. The project systematically assists asylum seekers whose demands have been dismissed in the first instance and provides for their legal representation before the appeals committee. 2. Judicial assistance Judicial assistance is offered to vulnerable individuals in areas of gross violation of fundamental rights, sexual violence, illegal pre-trial detention, incarceration of women and minors and torture. 3. Actions of reinforcement of local competences. The PIDDAR project looks to emancipate both the rights holders by promoting their access to simplified legal information and their aptitude to claim them, and the people carrying obligations and providing services by reinforcing their knowledge of their responsibilities and their capacities to honour them by respecting, promoting and simplifying the efficient exercise of the rights of asylum seekers and refugees. 4. Raising awareness and pleading Awareness will be raised amongst refugees and asylum seekers as to the rights and obligations of refugees. The procedures and the process undergone by the asylum applications from the moment they are submitted up to the definitive decision of recognition of the status or rejection of the application for asylum, will be supported during those sessions, in a participatory manner.;Through the PIDDAR project ASF wishes to contribute to the reinforcement of the international protection of refugees. The purpose is specifically to support the HCRâ€™s efforts in promoting procedures of equitable protection and protection against violence and exploitation by improving the legal security of asylum seekers and refugees in Burundi. Expected impact: - Result nÂ°1: A group of specialised lawyers is available and capable of providing legal and judicial services adapted to the beneficiaries; - Result nÂ°2: Asylum seekers and refugees in Burundi benefit from greeting, guidance, legal advice and free legal assistance; - Result nÂ°3: Law, asylum procedures and the rights of refugees are known, respected and disseminated by local authorities, police authorities and by the civil society; - Result nÂ°4: Good practice and the lessons learnt in the area of the execution of asylum procedure are identified and communicated to be capitalised by Burundese asylum authorities.;1. The final beneficiaries consist of: - Refugees present in the Burundian territory in a camp or in urban environments who encounter a problem of a legal and/or judicial nature - Asylum seekers, i.e. people asking Burundese authorities for international protection At least 1800 asylum seekers and refugees will benefit from a consultation before the end of the project (600 per year). At least 1,500 asylum seekers whose demands will have been rejected at first instance will benefit from legal assistance and representation before the appeals committee. At least 250 refugees and asylum seekers will benefit from legal aid by a competent lawyer. Awareness will be raised amongst at least 3,400 asylum seekers and refugees as to the rights and obligations of refugees and the legal undertaking of sexual assaults. Representatives from refugees and asylum seekers committees will be trained on the rights of refugees and the asylum procedure. 2. National asylum authorities: the National Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (ONPRA) and the Police of Air, Frontiers, and Foreigners (PAFE) will benefit from reinforcements of their competence in asylum rights. 3. Civil society organisations operating in the refugee and asylum seeker sector will also benefit from reinforcements of their competence in asylum rights and the international protection of refugees. 4. Project lawyers will benefit from regular training and coaching through the presence of an international coach and expert in asylum law.",2,,12/9/13,12/8/15,,0,0,0,0,;European Union;UNHCR,,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res;Office National de Protection des RÃ©fugiÃ©s et Apatrides (ONPRA),,BI,,,,,,,15130,1250,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,sdegee@asf.be,en,EUR,6/26/14 14:39,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,BE-BCE-0447404580,21,BE-BCE-0447404580-BURBELAL122401IN,Improving access to justice for vulnerable population groups in Burundi,"Being present in Burundi for more than ten years, the intervention strategy of ASF in the country is based upon the following principles: - Specialisation in legal aid to people in vulnerable situations: ASF has developed an expertise in the implementation of legal aid programs for the most vulnerable, based on 15 years of experience in fragile and/or developing countries. - Furthering the social role of the lawyer and strengthening his technical capacities: ASF works on strengthening the lawyer's capacities (and his independence), because he/she is a key actor concerning access to justice and the right to a fair trial, as well as an objective in its own right. Furthermore, ASF wishes to promote the social role of the lawyer that allows him/her to be an agent of change in regard to generating a progressive jurisprudence and/or boosting legal reform. - Synergy and partnership with stakeholders in the countries of intervention: ASF strives to engage in positive dialogue with actors in countries of intervention and to identify objectives and actions that are common or converging. - Sharing knowledge and lessons learned: To meet the challenges posed by our contexts of intervention, ASF has developed 'models' of intervention, endogenous and innovative mechanisms such as legal clinics and mobile court hearings. These projects include the idea of learning and assessment by both ASF and its partners with a capitalization and duplication vision. In Burundi, the project aims to 'develop access to coordinated and qualitative legal assistance for vulnerable people targeted by the National Strategy for Legal Aid (SNAL) in the three intervention provinces (Bujumbura, Gitega and Ngozi)', in accordance with: - The ASF mission; - The Sector Policy of the Government of Burundi, which intends to promote 'a request for a stronger justice system'; - The Strategic Plan of the Bar Association ('promote legal assistance activities and programmes that strengthen, protect, and serve the public'); - Lessons learned from the work field, from previous evaluations and from results of the study on legal aid made by ASF in 2011, from which we can conclude that thereâ€™s a lack of coordination between providers of legal aid and that the involvement of legal actors in charge of legal aid needs to be strengthened and sustained. The development strategy of coordinated access to legal assistance and quality of providers who are legally responsible for providing legal aid services to vulnerable populations in the provinces of Bujumbura-Mairie, Gitega and Ngozi is part of a framework of sustainability and progressive disengagement and is based on two axis: 1. The transfer of skills to national actors through the gradual transfer of legal aid services to the partner, i.e the Bar Association and the continued support in project management, the technical capacity building for lawyers, the reinforcement of authorities and the civil society in issuing reception, advice and guidance services at the provincial level. 2. Improved synergies and complementarity of intervening actors in the field of legal aid at the national and provincial level. The project is implemented in partnership with the Bar Association. Present mainly in the capital, the Bar Association will organize legal aid services in Bujumbura-Mairie, while ASF will organize these services in Gitega and Ngozi. The middle-term objective is that the institution can also arrange legal aid in the provincial sector of the country; a study on the feasibility of installing lawyers in the province is part of the project. To contribute to achieving the intended results of this project, another project will be implemented, also funded by Belgium (Synergy line with PIC), which aims to support the effective implementation of the National Strategy for Legal Aid in Burundi (SNAL), by conducting a study on the mechanisms of funding legal aid, and by providing ongoing support to the Thematic Group 'Application of Justice', which is responsible for the implementation of the SNAL at the national and provincial level. Activities of the project: So that the Bar Association is more capable of and adapted towards organising, managing and developing legal aid for those vulnerable people targeted by the SNAL in the province of Bujumbura-Marie in order to, eventually, repeat this in other provinces: - Support the activation of the Legal Aid Commission in the Bar Association; - Selection and implementation of a pool of 'legal aid' lawyers; - Organizational and managerial support to the Bar Association (Recruitment of a development coordinator of the legal aid project of the Bar/ASF); - Development of a professional training curriculum for lawyers in legal aid and training national trainers on the curriculum; - Development of a system of and tools for monitoring/evaluation of the Bar Associationâ€™s legal aid activities during a workshop; - Feasibility study on the installation of law firms in the province. To ensure judicial assistance in line with the minimum standards of legal representation to the vulnerable people targeted by the SNAL in the provinces of Bujumbura-Mairie, Gitega and Ngozi, and in order for a small group of lawyers to be fully equipped to provide this legal representation: - Training of the pool of lawyers conducted by trainers of the Bar Association assisted by experts, and coachingsessions of the pool of lawyers by experts; - Support to the pilot project 'Illegal preventive detention' and to the judicial assistance at the bottom of the Bar Association in the province of Bujumbura; - Systematic assistance of those accused who have been illegally detained in prisons in the provinces where ASF is intervening (Gitega and Ngozi); - Judicial assistance to those â€˜at the bottom' of the vulnerable categories targeted through the pool of lawyers in the provinces of Ngozi and Gitega; - Meetings of the Monitoring and Evaluation Committee and satisfaction surveys of the beneficiaries of judicial assistance of the Bar Association and ASF. So that the reception, advice, and guidance services to the vulnerable people targeted by the SNAL will be increasingly assured through 'synergy' between the different actors through a progressive accountability of the decentralised state structures in the coordination of actions in the provinces of Gitega and Ngozi: - Support the development of the Provicial Action Plans 2012/2013, strengthening the coordination mechanism, and coordination meetings/monthly monitoring at the provincial level; - Workshops legal capacity building of the student pool, of the Family Development Centers (FDC) of Gitega and Ngozi, and of the judicial services of the intervention prisons and the local government; - Sensitization actions and technical assistance/strengthening of the FDC and judicial services of prisons in the pilot provinces with the support of graduating law students; - Consultation activities and legal advice in the two legal clinics, in the intervention prisons and mobile legal aid clinics with the support of graduating law students.;Through this project, ASF wants to contribute to the development of a coordinated and qualitative access to legal assistance provided by those who are legally responsible for providing legal aid services to vulnerable people targeted by the National Legal Aid Strategy in Bujumbura-Mairie, Gitega, and Ngozi. Outcome 1: The Bar Association is more available and able to organize, manage, and develop access to legal aid for vulnerable persons targeted by the National Strategy for Legal Aid (SNAL) in the province of Bujumbura-Mairie to eventually be replicated in other provinces. - Outcome 2: A pool of lawyers is equipped to provide judicial assistance in accordance with the minimum standards of legal representation to vulnerable persons targeted by SNAL in Bujumbura-Mairie, Gitega, and Ngozi. - Outcome 3: The reception, advice, and guidance services to the vulnerable persons targeted by the SNAL are increasingly assured in synergy with the different actors through a progressive accountability of the decentralised state structures in the coordination of actions in the provinces of Gitega and Ngozi.;- The most vulnerable Burundian citizens targeted by the SNAL, being persons in pre-trial detention, women and children in detention, and victims of sexual violence in the provinces of Gitega, Ngozi, and Bujumbura: > At least 700 people will benefit from the legal assistance of a competent and trained lawyer; > At least 4,000 people will receive counseling and legal advice/guidance from a lawyer or a trained ASF partner (Family Development Centers and law students of the University of Ngozi); > At least 1,000 persons held in pre-trial detention will benefit from legal assistance in the prisons of Mpimba, Ngozi, and Gitega; > The Bar Association will be better able to deliver legal aid services; > Actors in the legal aid sector in the provinces have established a Joint Action Plan; > The national strategy for legal aid at the national level will be advanced; - The Bar Association of Bujumbura, of which the organizational and management capacities will be strengthened. - Lawyers and judicial defenders, who will benefit from regular training in the context of a training curriculum defined in cooperation with the Bar Association. - The legal aid NGOs, active in the concerned area, which will be better coordinated through the Provincial Fora of Legal Aid. - The Centers for Family Development and law students, who will benefit from capacity-building. - The population of Burundi, who will have better access to justice through legal aid.",2,,1/1/13,12/31/14,,0,0,0,0,;Belgian Development Cooperation,,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;Barreau de Bujumbura,,BI,,,,,,,15130,1001251,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,sdegee@asf.be,en,EUR,6/26/14 14:48,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,BE-BCE-0447404580,21,BE-BCE-0447404580-BELASFEXP143601,"Research project on access to justice, rule of law and development","For several years, ASF has been developing and sharing its expertise with the combined body of all key actors within the justice, human rights, and development sectors in order to play a major role in facilitating and coordinating a harmonious, effective cooperation amongst all such sectors. The challenge of this project is the further development of ASFâ€™s legitimacy within those sectors through the deepening of its expertise and increasing the reach and awareness of the organization in academia and development policy. With this in mind, the research project will capitalize on ASFâ€™s experience and activity according to a multidisciplinary scientific approach. The research project will contribute to repositioning the issue of access to justice towards the core of development policy priorities. This is especially timely in the context regarding the goals for development and implementation on the post 2015 millennium agenda. Scope The project aims to analyze and make explicit the links between access to justice, enforcement of the rule of law, and the progress being made in developing countries. This will be done through evaluation of the impact of ASF and other projects in these states which aim to improve access to justice. This project aims to meet the increasing scrutiny and demand for empirical proof or evidence showing the effects and impact of development projects and initiatives in the field of justice and governance. To do so, the research project will produce various outputs: scientific publications, internal capitalisation, impact studies. Research project and ASF The project will use data and evidence taken from ASF projects (on-going, past, and in development) as well as from its politics and strategies. The analysis, conclusions, and recommendations from the research project will contribute towards developing ASF projects and strategies. The research coordinator thus works closely with ASF strategic coordinators, experts, field staff and partners. Activities and deliverable: All along the course of the project: â€¢ Set up and animation of a network (or think tank) made up of academics and other actors focusing on research project findings. â€¢ Participation and/or presentation at 5 international conferences (in the field of access to justice, rule of law, fighting poverty in fragile states). â€¢ Counsel and scientific support on the quality, evaluation and impact of ASF projects. Year 3: â€¢ Scientific publication focusing on the link between access to justice, rule of law and development processes. â€¢ (Co-)Organisation of the conference on that thematic with participation of high level actors. â€¢ Publication of one or two impact evaluation (written in 2015) with a scientific approach. â€¢ Support to the development of projects proposals/country strategies. Year 2: â€¢ Impact evaluations of 1 or 2 ASF projects with a scientific approach. â€¢ Management of one or two large scale field surveys. â€¢ At least one publication on access to justice and rule of law effectiveness (written and accepted). â€¢ Support to the development of projects proposals/country strategies with innovative approach, increasing fundraising opportunities. Year 1: â€¢ Two ASF internal papers focusing on evaluation, links between ASF & academia and impact. â€¢ At least one publication on access to justice and rule of law effectiveness (written and accepted). â€¢ Support to the development of projects proposals/country strategies with innovative approach, increasing fundraising opportunities. ;The target groups are key justice and development international actors, academics, public actors and national and local NGOs. ;Strategic level: ASF is for the majority an object of study or an intriguing organization in the spheres of academia and influence in the developing world. Midway through the research project and in the long term, ASF aims to become an actor, co-constructor of knowledge and information influencing crucial political decisions regarding priorities, agenda, and mode of operation. The efforts of the research project are expected to further move ASF towards this mid- and long-term goal. In concrete terms, the project proposes to: - Short to medium term (1 to 2 years): contributing to adjusting or reorientating ASF programmes on the basis of research findings and recommendation in order to increase their effectiveness - Short to medium term: strengthen ASFâ€™s position as a key actor in the justice and governance sector through the development of ASFâ€™s expertise. The project aims to translate ASFâ€™s accumulated experience into knowledge and scientific theory which can be disseminated to key actors within academic and political spheres. - Long term (3 years and more): the project is building towards the ambition of ASF to hold a more mainstream role in the world of development aid in between human rights and development. ASF will take into account political orientations and development priorities in its efforts for access of justice and rule of law according to its mandate. Institutional level: The project will allow ASF: -To prepare post DFID PPA agenda, by increasing ASF expertise and visibility among high level actors and developing innovative approaches. -To strengthen the links between ASF and academia and policy actors. -Consideration may be given at the end of the project to broaden and institutionalize on a smaller or larger scale a research center for investing in other strategic research areas for ASF and solidify / capitalize on the successes and links created during the project.

These obstacles are characterised by a lack of human resources, the need to strengthen the capacities of members of the judicial system and material needs such as, among others, the construction and development of premises dedicated to the judiciary, the improvement of the transport system and the rehabilitation of prisons, which have a direct impact on the quality of the legal aid service delivered to individuals seeking justice. The population knows only very little about its rights. Abuses of power, as well as corrupt practices, are regularly reported, generating a problematic legal uncertainty. The importance of culture and traditions also has a decisive impact on the legal and regulatory framework. The traditional authorities, close to the population and enjoying both strong authority and broad powers, are often the first recourse in the case of problems or conflict. Moreover, the law grants them jurisdiction with regard to conciliation, which is done in application of traditional and customary rules, to the detriment of legal provisions which sometimes contradict these rules. There are very few lawyers in the country and almost all are concentrated in the capital, which makes recourse to their office particularly difficult for groups in vulnerable situations. This observation goes hand in hand with ignorance of the rights of vulnerable persons and weakens access to justice for these groups. The organisations of civil society (OSC) are genuinely committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and to the range of legal advice and judicial assistance services for the realisation of these rights: information, legal awareness, legal advice, referral, mediation and judicial assistance. Even though they number too few to sufficiently cover all of the needs of the population, they represent the main player of legal advice and judicial assistance and are the only ones that have genuine experience in this area. Unfortunately, the irregularity of institutional funding does not allow them to provide their services continuously. The purpose of ASF's intervention in the first instance is to mitigate this situation to a certain extent. Granting funding to the Chad OSCs is the most effective way to ensure that a minimum level of services is effectively delivered to the population. Legal advice and judicial assistance services targeting women, children and/or persons in detention will be established by the organisations with ASF's technical support and follow-up in order to ensure that these particularly vulnerable groups of people have effective recourse during the project. A geographic distribution will be proposed in order to ensure that the services covered by the project are not concentrated in a single region. That being said, the work of the OSCs could gain in efficiency and the quality of legal services can still be improved. Even the most experienced NGOs can make progress in these two areas. The technical support proposed by ASF 1) to assist in the development, implementation and assessment of the projects and 2) to share the legal knowledge necessary for the effective delivery of legal advice and judicial assistance services will make it possible to strengthen the legal advice and judicial assistance services funded as part of the intervention. The workshops for exchanging and sharing experiences will be opened to all those involved in legal advice and judicial assistance services and will set the framework for reflection on the institutionalisation and perpetuation of legal aid. A bill on legal advice and judicial assistance has been submitted to the Ministry of Justice which may be adopted shortly. It is therefore essential that a framework of consultation and coordination between those involved in legal advice and judicial assistance is maintained in order to follow the progress of the measures that will be adopted. However, while the NGOs recognise the importance of this process, originally prompted by them, and wish for their voices to be heard, they admit to having difficulties in coordinating amongst themselves on these issues and are rather favourable to the idea that an external party takes on responsibility for this coordination. The intervention also provides for work on this topic.;General aim: To contribute to the improvement of access to justice for persons in vulnerable situations in Chad. Specific aim: To reinforce the services of legal advice and judicial assistance delivered by Chad associations;Three Chadian organisations of civil society which will implement legal advice and judicial assistance services: the APLFT (Association pour la Promotion des LibertÃ©s Fondamentales au Tchad [Association for the Promotion of Fundamental Freedoms in Chad]), the AFJT (Association des Femmes Juristes du Tchad [Women Lawyers' Association of Chad]) and the PILC (Public Interest Law Center). Those involved in legal advice and judicial assistance who will benefit from a framework of exchange, sharing experiences and reflection aimed at better institutionalisation of legal aid in Chad: these are notably members of staff of the NGOs providing legal advice and judicial assistance services, the Department for Access to Law and Justice, the Ministry of Justice and the Bar. The women, children and/or persons in detention who will receive legal advice and judicial assistance services delivered by partner OSCs, three categories of persons who are particularly vulnerable with regard to access to legal advice and judicial assistance.

The bodies were set up without any real mechanisms for harmonisation and coordination, thus raising the question of relations between the various bodies, which were devised at different times and with different, sometimes overlapping mandates. The law on Transitional Justice was adopted by the ANC on 15 December 2013. Despite some criticism of the process leading to this adoption, the fact the law has come into effect may be an opportunity for the fulfilment of victims' rights. The bill on transitional justice provides for a set of mechanisms intended to seek the truth about violations of human rights, to bring criminal proceedings against the suspected perpetrators, to compensate and rehabilitate victims and to preserve the memory and establish guarantees of non-recurrence. In particular, this law provides for the creation of a 'Truth and Dignity Commission', which will be tasked with shedding light on the violations committed since the country became independent and setting up a damages compensation fund. The law also emphasises the role of judicial institutions responsible for proceedings against alleged perpetrators, as well as the need for measures to protect witnesses and victims to be interviewed as part of the process. Finally, the law establishes the principle of reforming state institutions (but without specifying the outlines) to allow dismantling of the system of corruption, repression and dictatorship and to remedy it for the purpose of preventing repetition of such violations and ensuring respect for human rights and the establishment of the rule of law. This notable advance must be recognised. Nevertheless, a number of issues remain to be clarified. It is therefore essential to continue efforts in order that Transitional Justice remains on the political agenda and that effective mechanisms are put in place, but also to advocate that these mechanisms be both transparent, integrated and above all, focused on the needs of victims. The purpose of this action is to put victims of serious human rights violations at the centre of the Transitional Justice process, enabling the effective exercise of their rights before the Tunisian courts and contributing to the development of Transitional Justice mechanisms tailored to their needs.;General aim: To contribute to the development in Tunisia of integrated and transparent mechanisms to manage the past, focused on the victims.

ASFâ€™s definition of vulnerability includes â€œall the people whose rights run the risk of not being defended properly, for whom access to law and justice is extremely limited or for whom law and justice so far, are oppression factorsâ€ù. ASF contribution to the rule of law starts from the point of view of the vulnerable and poor people. ASF wants to ensure that the creation or reinforcement of the rule of law in the fragile contexts will benefit them and not penalise them. ASF concentrates its actions on providing access to justice for vulnerable people, improving legal aid mechanisms, enhancing local actorsâ€™ capacities to answer legal assistance needs and working on better normative frameworks. This approach requires long term engagement for effective capacity building and transfer of expertise. In every area of intervention, ASF identifies target groups as being the most vulnerable depending on the circumstances (e.g. in DRC, women, children, prisoners in preâ€“trial detention, and victims of international crimes) and adapts its projects to address each groupâ€™s specific needs. ;With the PPA ASF will scale up its key areas of work, such as: - Provision of legal aid (mechanisms) for vulnerable people through expanding delivery of services and strengthening service delivery capacities of ASF partners; - Quality improvement of services delivered from national and international lawyers; e.g. through better evaluation, training and coaching - Legal protection for vulnerable people through advocacy work and networking. These will be achieved through: the expansion of activities, continuous improvement of methodologies and geographical expansion. Mainstreaming of gender will also be scaled up and expanded into researching and identifying new specific legal answers to womenâ€™s needs. The main new area of work that will be introduced thanks to the PPA concerns economic and social rights where violations and abuses (including those of companies) remain widely unpunished. Targeting the abuses committed by companies is directly linked to a logic of poverty reduction, in particular because it allows local populations to recover their rights and to engage the responsibility of the States. Civil society in fragile states is poorly informed and lacks the necessary expertise to know their rights. The possibility of finding national experts able to give legal advice or even to take a case before the courts is extremely scarce. The support of ASF has already been requested in DRC on a few cases of non-compliance with national and international legislation in relation to exploitation of natural resources and violations of the rights of native populations ;The national partners, such as Bar Associations, lawyers and NGOs contribute to ASF projects with their expertise and ability. As ASF seeks to strengthen the capacities of its partners (organising technical training, sharing tools, analyses, lessons learned) and help them to become more effective in their action and more autonomous in view of the sustainability of projects, Bar Associations, lawyers and NGOs are also intended to be beneficiaries. ASF promotes lawyers as key-players and lever for change and therefore raises the awareness of the legal profession about its social role. Throughout the programme period, it is expected that vulnerable people will gain awareness of their rights, an understanding of how to exercise them and benefit from quality advice and assistance when their rights are not respected. Partners will gain technical knowledge, awareness of their respective social role and responsibility toward the most vulnerable, as well as knowhow in providing access to justice.",2,,4/1/11,3/31/16,,0,0,0,0,;DFID,,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;;;;;;;;;;;,BE;BI;NP;CD;UG;TN;MA;CD;UG;TN;MA;TD,;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,;,;,15162;15130,50;501265,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,sdegee@asf.be,en,EUR,5/20/14 7:11,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,BE-BCE-0447404580,21,BE-BCE-0447404580-BURBELAL112401PRO,Support for the operationalization of the National Strategy for Legal Aid,"Having been in Burundi for more than 10 years, ASFâ€™s intervention strategy in the country is based on the following principles: - Specialisation in providing legal aid to vulnerable people: ASF has developed an expertise in implementing legal aid programmes to assist vulnerable people, which draws on 15 years of experience in fragile and/or developing States. - Promotion of the social role of lawyers and strengthening their technical abilities: ASF considers strengthening lawyersâ€™ abilities (and their independence) to be an objective in itself, as lawyers are essential agents in relation to access to justice and the right to a fair trial. Furthermore, ASF wants to promote the social role of lawyers as agents for change who are likely to generate a progressive jurisprudence and/or to stimulate legal reform. - Synergy and partnership with agents in the countries of intervention: ASF takes all possible steps to start a positive dialogue with agents in the countries of intervention, and to identify objectives and common or convergent action. - Sharing knowledge and lessons learned: in order to meet the challenges which are posed by the contexts of our interventions, ASF has developed â€œmodelsâ€ù of intervention, mechanisms which are endogenous and innovative, such as legal aid offices and mobile court hearings. The idea of learning and assessment is included in these projects, by ASF as well as by its partners, with a view to capitalisation and duplication. In Burundi, the project aims to provide â€œSupport for the operationalisation of the National Strategy for Legal Aidâ€ù, developed in 2010 under ASFâ€™s initiative, of which the objective is to develop legal aid services by bringing together and engaging different agents from the justice sector. This strategy is being carried out in agreement with: - The ASF mission; - The Sectoral Policies of the Burundian government, which intends to promote â€œa stronger demand for justiceâ€ù; - The Barâ€™s Strategic Plan (â€œto promote legal advice and assistance, and programmes which strengthen, protect and serve the publicâ€ù); - Lessons learned from practice, previous evaluations, and the results of the legal aid study which was carried out by ASF in 2011, which concluded there was a lack of co-ordination between different legal aid suppliers and that it was necessary to strengthen and perpetuate the engagement of agents who were lawfully in charge of legal aid. The project is being implemented in the capital and in three provinces of intervention, in synergy with the CTB, in complementarity with ASFâ€™s project DGD 2012-2014, and in conformity with the Ministry of Justiceâ€™s Sectoral Policy 2011-2015. The regions targeted (Mwaro, Muramvya and Bubanza), almost tally exactly with CTBâ€™s regions for action in the current project (Mwaro, Muramvya, Bubanza and Cibitoke). To contribute to the achievement of project results, another project is being implemented, also financed by Belgium (DGD 2012-2014). Its objective is to develop access to co-ordinated and high quality legal aid for categories of vulnerable people targeted in the National Strategy for Legal Aid (NSLA or SNAL in French) in the three provinces of intervention (Bujumbura, Gitega and Ngozi). Activities of the project: - Carrying out a feasibility study on the system for financing a legal aid fund. The study will be refined in 3 phases lasting a year, carried out by 2 external experts on behalf of the thematic group â€œDemande de Justiceâ€ù. The objective is to propose a realistic system for financing legal aid in close consultation with those who are involved in its future implementation: State (Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Finance), regional authorities, technical and financial partners (bilateral co-operations, international organisations, private foundations), agents for implementation (Bar, lawyers, national and local NGOs), agents for supervision and technical advice (international NGOs); - Support for meetings and activities of the thematic group â€œDemande de Justiceâ€ù; - Systematic judicial assistance to defendants in preventative detention at the pre-trial phase (in court chambers), and the jurisdictional phase in the 3 provinces of intervention; - The opening and functioning of a place for ASF legal consultations in Bubanza; - Judicial assistance for Incarcerated Minors; - Awareness raising/diffusing of information about the law and legal aid consultations in prisons; - Carrying out an analytical study of judicial practice concerning preventative detention in Burundi.;Specific objective: To contribute to the effective implementation of the National Strategy for Legal Aid in Burundi.

But free access to information and freedom of expression are deemed crucial: it is impossible for the population to fully participate in the political transition process or to sustainably address the basic economic and social issues that prompted the revolutions if these rights are not guaranteed. As of today, those rights and freedoms are regularly at stake and often violated. Some positive signs demonstrate that civil society actors, media stakeholders and lawyers are ready to taking up the challenge and are interested by ASFâ€™s approach based on fostering an open, constructive and technical dialogue based on the use of international standards as a reference tool and using the law as a motor for change. The reference to international human rights standards, which are still unfamiliar or poorly understood even by legal practitioners, has the potential to advance the jurisprudence but also to create an objective and dispassionate framework for discussion, at national, regional, and international level. Activities of the project: One baseline study in the three targeted countries, three training sessions for traditional/citizen journalists and bloggers, three training sessions and four on-site coaching sessions for lawyers, legal aid and assistance for traditional/citizen journalists and bloggers (20 cases), strategic litigation cases (2), setting up a regional platform for FOE stakeholders, workshops and publications.;The project, implemented primarily in Morocco, will involve a range of civil society actors, lawyers and legal practitioners, and key institutional and political stakeholders for freedom of expression (FOE) in Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.;The projectâ€™s global objective is to contribute to expand the space for FOE and media for traditional journalists, bloggers, and citizen journalists. The specific objective is to Protect traditional/citizen journalists and bloggers and support collective advocacy efforts promoting the use of international standards for FOE and FOP. Specific Objective: The specific objective is a direct response to the need for: - Reinforcing legal protection: victims of violation or abuses have access to a legal and judicial response consistent with international standards; - Strengthen capacities to contribute effectively to establishment of FOE/FOP frameworks consistent with international standards. Expected impact: The results to be achieved are: 1) traditional/citizen journalists and bloggers master their legal environment and international standards; 2) A regional network of lawyer is specialized in the legal protection of FOE/FOP actors; 3) Legally and professionally enabling environments consistent with international standards for FOE and FOP are promoted at both national and regional level. Built around the positive role that lawyers can play in strengthening the rule of law and FOE protection, this project is expected to impact on two different levels: 1) lawyers will influence the work of FOE stakeholders and stakeholders in the justice system and political institutions; 2) the project will facilitate the application of human rights standards for FOE, especially as linked to gender-based discrimination.",2,10/1/13,10/1/13,9/30/15,,0,0,0,0,";US Dept of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL)",,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;;,EG;MA;TN,20;35;45,,,,;,;,15162;15130,50;501267,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,sdegee@asf.be,en,EUR,5/20/14 8:37,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,BE-BCE-0447404580,21,BE-BCE-0447404580-BELUEJI13210IN,Promoting the full implementation of the Rome Statute principles,"Every year, new conflicts arise around the world and thousands of people become victims of serious human rights violations. They are often far from national and international judicial institutions, and are deprived of their right to access to justice (right to participate in proceedings). Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res (ASF) is involved in facilitating the work between local populations and tribunals, and has developed a variety of strategies to make the right of access to justice a reality for the most vulnerable sectors of the worldâ€™s population. Through the project â€œPromoting the full implementation of the Rome Statute principlesâ€ù, ASF seeks to apply the principle of complementarity. ASFâ€™s objective with this project is to contributing to the full implementation of the Rome Statute principles by strengthening access to justice. ASF developed its expertise in fighting impunity for international crimes through its work in DRC since 2005. Through a project started in 2010, ASF has be able to give victims access to legal proceedings before national courts and the ICC in the DRC, Burundi, Uganda, Nepal, Colombia and in Guatemala in partnership with ASF-Canada. Activities of the project: - Advocacy workshops aimed at the ICC, national authorities and regional organisations for ratification and implementation legislation; - Trial monitoring; - Capacity building of lawyers, law students and CSOs through trainings, individual coaching and moot courts; - Volunteer coaching missions for lawyers in Colombia and Guatemala; - Legal assistance for victims before the ICC, especially for women; - Legal representation for the most vulnerable people before national courts; - Advocacy meetings and publications aimed at national authorities and regional organisations for cooperation.;Specific objectives of the project: - Strengthening national legal frameworks by promoting ratification of the Rome Statute, contributing to its effective implementation within national legislation, and increasing target groupsâ€™ awareness of the Rome Statute system. - Improving the effective exercise of rights before the ICC and national jurisdictions in accordance with the principle of complementarity and standards of fair trial. Expected impact: - Progress toward the ratification of the Rome Statute, adoption of implementation legislation, and necessary structural reforms aiming at guaranteeing the full implementation of the Rome Statute principles in the targeted countries. - Enhanced application of the Rome Statute in national jurisdictions and increased awareness of the most affected communities. - Improved capacities of lawyers to litigate cases under the Rome Statute and of the key stakeholders to address international criminal cases before the ICC and national jurisdictions. - Increased implementation of the ICCâ€™s decisions and requests for cooperation.;- Individual and community victims of international crimes, especially women; - Civil society actors and associations of legal professionals; - National legal systems; - The ICC",2,10/22/13,10/22/13,4/21/16,,0,0,0,0,;European Union;MacArthur Foundation,,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res Canada;Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC),;;;;;,CD;BI;UG;NP;CO;GT,30;15;15;15;15;10,,,,,,15130,1001268,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,sdegee@asf.be,en,EUR,5/20/14 8:37,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,BE-BCE-0447404580,21,BE-BCE-0447404580-TUNUEDES131801IN,The defense of economic and social rights of vulnerable groups in the Monastir and Minier bassin regions,"The Tunisian revolution was prompted by the marginalised social class mobilising to claim their rights to a dignified life and the right to work. This revolution enabled Tunisia to transition toward a democracy devoted to the principles of participation in politics and freedom of expression. However, after more than a year after the revolution, Tunisia still faces the economic and social problems that were the main reason for the protests in December 2010, and people continue to feel excluded and frustrated. If nothing is to be done to enable Tunisians to freely express themselves and to translate their frustrations and legitimate demands, the peaceful transition toward a democratic state based on the rule of law will be threatened. 1. The people in Tunisia in vulnerable situations face structural unemployment, lack of transparency in the recruitment processes for the civil service and the public sector companies, poor working conditions, environmental pollution, poorly equipped regional hospitals, and other problems that deprive them from the acceptable living conditions necessary for full human rights realisation. Many of these problems are structural, giving the impression that large financial investments are needed to resolve them. This idea is nevertheless mistaken, and the human rights claims being discussed can be resolved if there is political will to effectively manage limited resources so that the whole society can benefit, rather than only the powerful few. Civil society facing this difficult political economic reality can empower themselves through a human rights-based approach, demonstrating that injustice is not inevitable, and to focus on who is responsible for solving the problems that hinder people from realising their human rights. 2. In Tunisia, the organisations and associations that exist respond to these problems through the advocacy and community organising skills that helped bring about the revolution. Post-revolution, a new approach is needed; an approach that takes uses the international human rights framework, to support their claims, and the legal system to claim them. ASF is working with the different sections of the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social rights to strengthen their capacity to take on more cases, combining ASFâ€™s expertise in human rights-based approach and the Forumâ€™s experience in advocacy. This project is focused on defending human rights by ensuring that the legal structure is capable of protecting these rights. Activities of the project: - Training on the human rights-based approach; - Negotiations with those responsible on specific human rights issues; - Educate and train Forum personnel and members on methods used for collective defence of those people in vulnerable situations; - Forum takes on the cases of these vulnerable individuals; - Training of lawyers on economic and social rights; - Legal representation of certain cases by compensated lawyers.;Overall objective: - Reinforce social cohesion - Support the construction of a State that respect human rights - Reduce the number of social conflicts caused by economic and social exclusion Specific objective: The Tunisian Forum for the Economic and Social Rights, in partnership with ASF, supports social inclusion of disadvantaged people in the regions of Monastir and Gafsa through the collective defense of their social and economic rights. Expected impact: - The Forum uses the human rights-based approach and concentrates its discourse on State human rights obligations; - The Forum sections support disadvantaged social groups in order to defend their economic and social rights; - People in vulnerable situations have access to legal recourse if negotiations fail.;- 65 members or employees of the Tunisian Forum for the Economic and Social Rights - 50 lawyers from the Monastir, Gafsa and the surrounding regions - 720 vulnerable individuals from the Monastir and Gafsa region - 1650 disadvantaged people from the Monastir and Gafsa region whose economic and social rights were violated In the Monastir region, the targeted group (the most populous one) will comprises women working in the textile industry. Of around 60,000 workers in the sector, 90% are women, only 8% belong to trade unions, and 50% come from impoverished regions of the country (Gafsa, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzid) and live in extremely poor conditions in Monastir. The most commonly violated right the non-affiliation to the social security system (CNSS), failure to pay extra working hours, and working conditions that do not comply with the law guaranteeing a healthy environment. The majority of factories do not respect the Tunisian Labour Code. In the Gafsa region, the priority group are the unemployed youth, the individuals who are directly or indirectly victims of corruption, and vulnerable workers. The four villages in the mining region: Mdile, Mdila, Redeyef, Metlaoui and Oumlares are priorities. The last census in 2004 counted 120,000 people in the 4 towns, with around 28% unemployment. While the rate is considered to have risen, there are no current available statistics. Gafsa has been isolated from the rest of the country, and there has been almost no investment in the region. The biggest employer is the Gafsa Phosphate Company, but the number of people working there has decreased over the years due to production chain automation.",2,1/1/13,1/1/13,6/30/14,,0,0,0,0,;European Union,,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,;Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res;Forum tunisien des droits Ã©conomiques et sociaux (FTDES),,,,,,,,,,1269,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,sdegee@asf.be,en,EUR,5/20/14 8:10,Avocats Sans FrontiÃ¨res,BE-BCE-0447404580,21,BE-BCE-0447404580-OUGBELAL122401IN,Promotion of Pro Bono - Mobilising lawyers to defend the rights of Ugandans,"The provision of lawyersâ€™ free legal aid services to people who are not able to pay for it is merely in its infancy in Uganda. Although the â€œAdvocates Actâ€ù was amended in 2002 so that all registered lawyers have an obligation to provide free legal aid services, it was not until August 2009 that this law and this requirement became a reality on the ground. The profession is now at a crucial stage in this regard, inasmuch as the Law Council and the Uganda Law Society have joined forces to put pressure on the legal profession so that it meets its obligations. The ULS is working on Pro Bono programme covering the whole country, but it lacks the human resources and organisational tools to manage the programme in a way that would guarantee its success. ASF considers it vital to support this programme and to increase its links with other legal aid service providers so as to ensure that the Ugandan model can serve as an example to governments and legal professionals. Activities of the project: - Promotion of lawyersâ€™ commitment to pro bono legal work, setting up collaboration between those involved in legal aid. - Launching a pilot programme of pro bono legal services in the Central Regionâ€™s courts (establishment of offices). - Training lawyers on the topic of intervention and on mediation techniques. - Establishment of systems for monitoring and evaluating legal aid by the ULS. - Advocating the development and effective implementation of laws and national policies which protect the rights of vulnerable people (by publishing studies and supporting strategic litigation).;Specific objectives: Increase the ability of Ugandan lawyers to protect the rights of vulnerable people in a lasting manner. - Outcome 1: Development of pro bono legal aid services for vulnerable people. - Outcome 2: Improved ability of lawyers to provide quality legal services to vulnerable people. - Outcome 3: Improved monitoring and evaluation systems for the ULSâ€™s legal assistance. - Outcome 4: Advocacy for development and implementation of laws and/or national policies which protect the rights of vulnerable people. Expected impact The project focuses on the need to cultivate the spirit of volunteerism, by expanding the network of lawyers providing pro bono services. The information and guidance given to members of the communities which are targeted by the legal advice sessions will be shared with family and friends, and will therefore have a continuously multiplying effect. By carrying out mobile legal consultations, the project will create a link with community leaders in rural areas, who will be encouraged to promote the ULSâ€™s legal services to members of their community, and also those of other suitable legal aid service providers. This outreach will be particularly advantageous for women, who find it more difficult to leave their homes and travel to big cities, and who are often disadvantaged by traditional practices and informal justice mechanisms. A greater protection of their rights will therefore impact beneficially on their children, and will have long term effects on their economic status, especially where land rights are at stake. The ULSâ€™s legal advice centres will improve links with local government, lawyers and other service providers in their area of activity, which will improve coordination and open up new ways to be efficient. The ULS will have closer links with other legal aid providers thanks to networking and sharing their experiences of the project with each other, facilitated by the ULS. This will improve the ability of the legal aid providers network to influence policy in this area and eventually to ensure greater government support for its vital services. Training and supervision of ULS and its members in action campaigns and strategic procedures will have a long term effect on their ability and motivation to permanently engage in advocacy for a political and legislative environment that protects the rights of the poor and other vulnerable people. Even before effective changes in policy or law come about, this will enhance dialogue and will allow debate between civil society organisations like the ULS and decision-makers. These political discussions will themselves be a sincere contribution for a society that is still struggling to achieve full compliance with democratic principles. Bearing in mind the common law system in Uganda, which means that courts can create, and often do create, law through jurisprudence, the introduction of strategic litigation is particularly significant and likely to result in lasting legal precedents that bind the lower courts until they are contradicted by the law or a higher court.;- The project aims to improve the situation and respect for the rights of the most vulnerable people in Uganda, in particular women and children. By improving legal aid services to the poor in remote areas, and legal structures for the protection of vulnerable people, the ULS will fulfill its role as a watchdog of democracy and human rights in Uganda, thus acting as an important counterbalance to the power of the executive and legislative branches. - ASFâ€™s expertise will be shared with the ULS and its members, to strengthen their ability to provide high quality legal aid services to these people, including victims of international crimes, domestic violence, gender-based violence, torture and child-trafficking, as well as people held in illegal detention. - Because of the geographical coverage of ULSâ€™s mobile legal consultations in Kampala and six remote districts of the country, a broad section of society will benefit from access to legal aid services. - On the basis of our shared commitment to strengthening lawyersâ€™ social responsibility, ASF and the ULS will work to cultivate a passion for human rights work, and for the development of a pro bono spirit among lawyers across the various project components. - Organisations within Ugandan civil society, including the ULS and in particular human rights defenders, are the driving force which works to strengthen legal protection for the most vulnerable. Working with co-ordination mechanisms such as the Legal Aid Service Providers Network (LASPNET), the Human Rights Network (HURINET), the Coalition against Torture (CAT) and the â€œAssociation des femmes avocates ougandaisesâ€ù (FIDA-Uganda), the project will promote experience sharing and speaking with one voice in order to achieve broader access to justice and a general strengthening of the justice sector. - The end beneficiaries will include all clients who receive legal aid services; all lawyers, law students and legal aid service providers who receive the information distributed by the project, or who participate in the forums which are organised or in the projectâ€™s networking events.

Whether they are members of civil society organizations, community leaders, paralegals, social workers, media workers, volunteers or lawyers, HRDs share a common objective: they act, individually or with others, to promote and/or protect human rights. Through their actions, HRDs build bridges between vulnerable people prevented from accessing and enjoying their basic human rights, and states authorities, who had promised, through international engagements, to ensure the respect, protection and promotion of these rights. These defenders ensure that societyâ€™s most marginalized peoplesâ€™ voices are heard, providing them with information on how to best defend their interests, investigating sensitive issues that affect the realization of their rights, and exerting pressure to turn governmentsâ€™ promises into concrete and sustainable actions. HRDs are often confronted with attempts to limit their capacities to defend and promote human rights while carrying out their work. These attempts take various forms: physical threats, administrative or judicial harassment, criminal charges, and sometimes violent crimes (such as assault, torture, killings, etc). The general objective of the project is to contribute to the protection of human rights in the regions of the African Great Lakes and Eastern Africa (hereafter, the Region), by ensuring that lawyers and other HRDs receive support and stronger protection. The 3 years project, financed by the European Union, is implemented in partnership with the East Africa Law Society (EALS) in 5 countries in the Region: Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda. All activities are organized within the framework of a regional strategy which aims to provide both an emergency response, in the short term, and structural and lasting solutions in the long term: - in the short term, it is necessary to take immediate and often urgent measures. It will be done in the form of direct assistance (notably financial and material) for specific needs (medical, psychological, logistical, etc.) and through providing high quality legal assistance to HRDs (whose activities are criminalized or who have been victims of threats, violations of their physical integrity or attacks). - in the long term, it is about creating the conditions for a lasting strategy involving various national (national bar associations and civil society) as well as regional structures (EALS and other regional networks). Therefore the project has established a pool of 42 lawyers from the Region, who are committed to human rights. In order to provide high quality legal services (legal representation, mediation, amicus curiae, trial observations, etc.) to HRDs, these lawyers benefit from high-level trainings throughout the project. Advocacy strategies are also implemented in order to promote and contribute to the development of a legal framework designed to provide specific protection to HRDs and the emergence of good practices in state institutions in the Region. Finally, the key component of this project is the creation of a regional dynamic among HRDs, lawyers, institutions, protection organizations and networks, donors and other stakeholders, through the establishment of a funding mechanism (Protection Trust Fund â€“ PTF), designed to provide comprehensive and long lasting responses to HRDsâ€™ protection issues. Although the Region benefit from a considerable number of programmes and initiatives designed to strengthen the protection of HRDs, there is a lack of regional coordination or collaboration among key stakeholders, disruptions in the responses given on protection issues and unequal funding sources between countries or sub-regions. In collaboration with other initiatives being implemented in the Region, the PTF will aim to ensure that HRDs receive increased legal and personal protection throughout the Region, regardless of their country of origin or their first request for support.;Specific objectives of the project: lawyers and other HRDs in the African Great Lakes and in East Africa receive support and stronger protection.

The campaign is based on a decade-long engagement between DFID and education stakeholders in Pakistan from 2001 to 2011 that essentially determined the need for a dramatic change in the level of active political engagement on education issues. The theory of change for the project is that a greater degree of political salience for education is a prerequisite for any transformational change to take place in education in Pakistan. The state of Pakistan's education crisis is uncontested. There are currently 25 million children between ages five and sixteen that are out of school. The campaign has three key audiences: politicians and political parties, education providers (including teachers and administrators) and finally, Pakistani parents. Each audience is approached using different techniques, and the sum total of effort is designed to yield a fundamental change in the way the mainstream Pakistani political discourse deals with the education challenge. As long as the education crisis can be passed onto 'the development people' it will continue to suffer from low investment (Pakistan spends only 1.9% of its GDP on education), and from low accountability (teacher absenteeism is a chronic problem, often hovering at 20%). There are five core strands that the campaign depends on to enhance education's standing in the mainstream political discourse: Direct political advocacy, the media, civil society and direct community engagement, research and evidence and finally, the international community. Several pioneering efforts have been tested by the Alif Ailaan campaign and less than a year into operation, the campaign is already recognised as a trailblazer in areas like education and school infrastructure league tables for districts, cross platform activism and engaging senior journalists and politicians.",2,,9/1/12,2016-10-31;2016-10-31,,0,0,2866704,2387138,;UK Government,;DfID,,;HTSPE;Accadian Ltd,Pakistan,PK,,,,,,,11110,1039,HTSPE Limited,keith.smith@htspe.com,en,GBP,11/19/14 4:19,HTSPE,GB-COH-06407873,70,GB-COH-06407873-GB-1-203574,Strengthening Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change in Kenya Plus (StARCK+),"The DFID funded StARCK+ programme follows on from the original StARCK programme (2011-2013), which supported a range of activities to assist in Kenyaâ€™s approach to climate change, including contributions to Climate Innovation Centre (CIC), the African Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) REACT window, the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) and county level adaptation measures.

The main objectives of this project are to increase access to education and human capital development,enhance capacities to sustain a national school feeding programme and stimulate agricultural and economic development by linking school feeding with local production. The programme aimed to increase enrolment and attendance rates and to reduce the dropout rates in the schools in the targeted districts,as well as improve the girl to boy ratio. The project has been extended for one year until 30 June 2014. Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 4 and 5 'to reduce chronic hunger and under nutrition' and 'to strengthen the capacities of countries to reduce hunger',including through hand-over strategies and local purchase,this project aimed to complement the government school feeding activities overseen by the Directorate of School Feeding (DSF) within the Ministry of Education,a body effectively put in place in 2013. The government's programme operated in schools where WFP was not providing food. However,the government indicated it needed additional time to further build on its institutional and policy capacity towards a nationally-owned school feeding programme.

Although its vanilla is highly sought after over the world, the majority of the 80,000 small-scale farmers who produce the vanilla experience food insecurity. This is caused by the fact they do not earn sufficient income to adequately provide food for themselves and their families throughout the year. About 75% of the small farmers in Madagascarâ€™s SAVA region â€“ the main vanilla producing region â€“ live below US$1 a day. Fairfood works on having solid methodologies in place for assessing a fair price. Furthermore we engage with multinational brands and flavour houses sourcing vanilla from Madagascar to increase their awareness on the issues farmers face, and to ensure that these small farmers receive a fair income. These companies can and should help farmers to break out of the cycle of poverty by ensuring that these smallholder farmers are paid a fair price for their vanilla. A fair price covers, amongst other things, a living wage for farmers, any other labour either from family members or hired labourers, plus all costs and risks involved in the production, and ensures a certain degree of stability over time.",2,,9/17/13,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,MG,100,,,,,,15162,1001204,Transnational Institure,rvermeulen@tni.org,en,EUR,11/18/14 21:04,Transnational Institute,NL-KVK-23066083,21,NL-KVK-23066083-test01,Dit is een test,projectbeschrijving,1,,4/1/14,,,0,0,0,0,,,,;org 1,wat? wat,MM,76,,,,,,,1624,Transnational Institure,rvermeulen@tni.org,en,EUR,11/18/14 19:33,Transnational Institute,NL-KVK-23066083,21,NL-KVK-23066083-Tessa Test ook wat,Test project Tessa,Tja wat zal ik erover zeggen;De goal van deze test is om eens te kijken of ik iets hiermee kan voor de website,,11/21/14,,,,0,0,0,0,,,;Hilde,,,,,,,,,,,1634,Transnational Institure,rvermeulen@tni.org,en,EUR,11/18/14 20:49,Transnational Institute,NL-KVK-23066083,21,NL-KVK-23066083-FGGKP3,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,;equit,,BR,,,489,,,,,1207,Friends of the Earth International,finance@foei.org,en,EUR,4/1/14 15:02,Friends of the Earth International,NL-KVK-40535338,21,NL-KVK-40535338-2012-03-01,Campaigning against grabbing community land in Kalangala,"FoE Uganda will use the funds to improve the ability of communities to prevent land-grabbing from palm oil company (BIDCO) and reinforce the regulation.

Kagonya, on Bunyama Island. The activities planned were: community trainings on basic community land-rights and entitlements, engagement with local government and company representatives, exchange visit between the people of Bugala and Bunyama where BIDCO is intending to expand palm oil, Developing and printing advocacy materials such as t-shirts and brochures, sharing experience on land grabbing with other partners in the international meetings Network with a district NGO umbrella called KADINGO, so we were working with almost all the CBOS and CSOs in the district. This was a great opportunity because women groups, youth groups and the drama groups would never missed-out in our engagement meetings. Largely the role of KADINGO was mobilizing and networking with the groups for effective advocacy. The results were: Local communities have been made aware their status of tenures to prevent reckless evictions as the preventing measures to land-grabbing by government and the developers. Those who were on any land for 12 years before the coming into force of the 1995 Uganda constitution are the rightful bonefide occupants. Campaign materials developed (t-shits, video documentary, and brochures) and were used at local national and international levels.

Training involves basic farming, farm management and entrepreneurship. The focus is on improved methods, increased diversity, higher productivity, access to markets and protecting the environment;Target Group: for 750 subsistence farmers and their families in Bengo province. The 750 farmers will be organized in 15 clubs of 50 members. Women will be encouraged to become members and participate in the project activities on an equal footing with men.;Goal:to enable the farmers to become food secure and produce a surplus to market during the three project years. After this period, the farmers are equipped with the skills, knowledge, experience and income generating capacity to continue expanding their production.;Background: Most families live from subsistence agriculture and food insecurity is an issue at certain times of year. Few The farmers received no training and there is little evidence of any kind of organization or cooperative farming, both of which could lead to improved circumstances. Traditionally women in Angola carry out much of the family-level subsistence agricultural production, which also is the situation in Bengo province. However the women are not normally involved in determining the planning of what and how much to grow, much less in how to use the surplus production. Nambuangongo is one of the areas in Bengo province with a relatively high population density, making it possible to organize the farmers. ;Project Plan: The 750 farmers will be organized in 15 clubs of 50 members. The Club project leaders will be trained in all aspects of project implementation. Women will be encouraged to become members and participate in the project activities on an equal footing with men. As soon the members have joined the club, Farmersâ€™ Club Committees are elected and start their training. The Farmers Club project aims at improving the general standard of living for the farmer and his or her family through increased knowledge and skills in taking care of the health, education and wellbeing of the whole family. By creating viable structures for the farmers in the project area they become organised and productive. Access to markets will be facilitated and/or strengthened.

Radio has grown rapidly in Pakistan in recent years. Local audiences in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and in the remote Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) now have many entertainment channels to listen to, with lots of music and chat shows, but audiences also want radio stations to broadcast news and information about important events in their community. In FATA and KP, however, local radio still provides very little news reporting. As a result, the people of the tribal areas depend on foreign radio services for information on local events because no independent media outlet is providing this local news for radio broadcast. The growth of private television stations has benefited many people in Pakistan but in the tribal areas cable television is often not available. Being a conservative area, local people often consider television to be inappropriate and because of widespread illiteracy, especially among women, many people cannot read newspapers, so radio has long been the most popular medium for news and information in Pashto-speaking areas. Tribal News Network hasÂ been created to meet the needs of people in FATA and KP who want reliable news about their communities. ;The general objectives of TNN are as follows: * To provide fair, balanced and independent news to audiences in Pushto-speaking areas. * To provide local news to underserved areas. * To empower local citizens by providing information on social and political issues. * To provide female audiences in particular with access to information, as women often lack other means of access to information. * To encourage more women to work in journalism to improve content for female audiences. * To help integrate the 50% of KP-FATAÂ´s population who are illiterate into mainstream society by providing essential information. Objectives of TNN with this one-year operational grant are the following: * TNN is operating as a professional organisation broadcasting local radio news items and with a clear plan for the future. * TNNÂ´s network of radio partners is increased to at least 10 stations. * The local population is better informed and able to understand events in their community based on independent news information provided by TNN, thus enabling them to make sensible political and life decisions.;* Tribal News Network * Local audiences of TNN\'s local radio partner stations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and in the remote Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)",3,,11/1/13,,10/31/14,0,106259,24.33,0,;Ministry of Foreign Affairs,,;Free Press Unlimited,;Tribal News Network,,PK,,,,,,DAC,15163,1702,Free Press Unlimited,schootuiterkamp@freepressunlimited.org,en,EUR,1/20/15 17:04,Free Press Unlimited,NL-KVK-52957535,21,NL-KVK-52957535-P-NI-01-14-04,WADADA News for Kids - PROMEDIA,"This project is relevant because it fills a gap in the supply of information to children and youth in Nicaragua. This age group is targeted by the media with consumption goods and entertainment. They are hardly ever targeted as potential active agents of change. The proposed project aims to increase the access of children and youth to relevant news and current affairs, to inform them about their rights and spark their sense of citizenship. FPU develops independent media channels: media in Nicaragua is torn between government propaganda and commercial considerations and programming. Even public television is at the service of the political party ruling the country. Most media outlets are dedicated to repeating official propaganda, or air-brushing reality, to create the illusion of the country as utopia. A few independent outlets remain. Only DHTV is aimed at children and youth. In terms of audience, Furthermore this new project is relevant because it will, next to contributing to the production of De Humo, also have a strong focus on the sustainability of the news program. They are on the right track but need more time to explore and roll out different options. The sustainability of De Humo will contribute to the KNN network. In addition, PROMEDIA is a private production company which considers itself to have a watch dog function in society. Given the strong influence of the state and business world on media in Nicaragua, a partner with this profile is the only guarantee for editorial independence. ;Nicaragua is a country â€œoverflowing with youthâ€ù; over one third is aged 14 or under.

Bolivia\\\\\\\'s television landscape is characterized by scarcity in terms of quality children\\\\\\\'s programming. Very little good and relevant information is available on TV and online which encourages children, teenagers and young people to actively participate in society. Internet access is increasing thourghout the country, but few websites provide the target group with relevant and at the same time entertaining information. Television programming for minorities is in development; in 2012, ATB, a national commercial channel and host of PICA, launched a daily news programme in Quechua, one of Bolivia\\\\\\\'s native languages. Mis- and underrepresentation of vulnerable groups in the media is a global and endemic phenomenon. FPU is part of the Child Rights Alliance (CRA) lead by Plan Netherlands. The CRA focuses on improving the lives of girls and young women in developing countries. Project partner Nicobis believes that a KNN programme in Bolivia will contribute to this aim because the television programmes can raise awareness on the social inequality in gender and the ethnical exclusion in children and young people. The children and young people can speak with their own voices about the poverty, socio-cultural diversity, segregation, asymmetrical relations in education and healthcare, differences in access to goods and services, stereotypes and stigmatisation based on relationships of superiority and power.

R1: SC will hold orientation sessions with community representatives and conduct a situation analysis with the support of the Public Health Directorate to identify areas where MHTs and the OTP will operate. A MHT will be staffed with one male health provider (doctor or nurse), one female health provider (doctor, community midwife or female nurse), one vaccinator and one driver. Mobile health staff will receive initial training and refresher and on the job trainings. Each MHT will establish a service delivery point in the community and will work approx. 20 days a month. The package of services provided by MHTs will be based on the BPHS guide for MHT. MHTs will refer more serious cases to primary health facilities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) will be trained by Community Mobilisers and Health Posts will be established, supervised, and supplied by AHDS (local partner) and the mobile team. After initial training, the MHTs and Community Health Supervisors (CHSs) of the nearest health facility will be responsible for conducting supportive supervision, collecting reports, provision of on the job training and re-supplying.

They will receive a cash transfer $60/month/HH for 3 months. R3:SC will conduct a SMART nutrition survey to assess the nutritional status of children 6 to 59 months and estimate retrospective mortality rates in the IDP communities in Kandahar province. SC will expand its existing Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme by establishing one additional OTP in an IDP location. Children with severe acute malnutrition but no medical complications are treated through an OTP that provides ready-to-use therapeutic food and treatment of common illnesses. These OTP services are set up in partnership with BPHS health facility staff and will be established within a MHT. Children with moderate acute malnutrition will be referred to a supplementary feeding programme implemented by AHDS with the support of WFP. Education sessions for caregivers will raise awareness on infant feeding, hygiene and hand washing practices. CHWs will be trained in case finding referral of acutely malnourished children using mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and follow up. In addition to the proposed action in Kandahar, SC will work with NRC to deliver a Household Economy Approach (HEA) for one food economy zone in the north of Afghanistan, covering Saripul, Southern Balkh and Samangan.;The action will deliver an integrated approach to address the humanitarian needs of displaced populations in Kandahar. The action will increase access to health services by establishing mobile health teams and health posts, increase access to food for food insecure households via provision of cash transfers and engaging communities in cash for work, and improve the understanding of malnutrition and people's access to food.;The beneficiary target group are IDPs. In Kandahar, IDPs have been primarily displaced from within Kandahar or surrounding provinces (Helmand, Uruzgan) due to conflict. A smaller number are displaced by natural disasters, or due to economic hardships. ;De dorre provincie Kandahar is een van Afghanistan's grootste en minst bevolkte provincies. Het deelt een poreuze internationale grens met het Balochistan district in Pakistan. Kandahar heeft een bevolking van 990.100, waarvan 68% in de rurale districten woont die gekenmerkt worden door een hoog niveau van armoede en conflict. Kandahaar is zeer ontvankelijk voor conflict en onveiligheid wat de grootste veroorzakers van humanitaire noden blijven. De provincie wordt als een van de hoogste, waar het gaat om aantal gerapporteerde veiligheidsincidenten en open conflicten, gerangschikt. Doelgerichte moorden, bezetting van de gezondheids en onderwijs infrastructuur, intimidatie en onrust hebben geleid tot ontheemding, burger slachtoffers, de onderbreking van basisdiensten of het onvermogen van mensen om toegang tot diensten te hebben. Bescherming van burgers is een grote zorg. Ondanks bijvoorbeeld ICRC's taxi diensten die vervoer zonder medische ondersteuning naar het ziekenhuis verzorgen, is er nog steeds een significant gebrek aan medische voorzieningen voor slachtoffers van het conflict. Het gebrek aan zulke diensten vertaalt zich direct in toegenomen sterftecijfers met name onder burgers. Tevens heeft Kandahar een groot aantal ontheemden. Volgens schattingen van UNHCR zijn er 40.257 ontheemden Kandahar-stad en 5.250 in Daman. De IDP en vluchtelingen autoriteit in Spin Boldak schat dat er 19.481 ontheemden in het district zijn. Hoewel er geen informatie is over de toestroom van ontheemden als gevolg van het conflict in de periode 2011 - 2013 wordt er verwacht dat als gevolg van het verwachte oplaaiende conflict in Kandahar de toestroom van ontheemden zal toenemen. UNHCR schat dat, de komende 12 maanden, 2-3,000 huishoudens zullen vluchten naar Kandahar, afkomstig uit Kandahar, Helmand en Uruzgan. Provinciala data laten zien dat Kandahar de provincie is met het hoogste aantal gevallen van diarree, zware verkoudheid en zware oor, neus en keelontstekingen. In 2013 waren er 13 uitbraken van cholera en de mazelen. Verder blijkt uit de informatie uit de focus groep discussies dat er ernstige beperkingen in de toegang tot medische diensten zijn. De gemiddelde afstand tot de dichtstbijzijndste gezondheidsfaciliteit is 1,5 uur lopen. Vooral vrouwen worden hierdoor beperkt omdat zij deze afstand om culturele redenen niet alleen kunnen lopen. Een ambulance of ander transport zijn niet beschikbaar bij de medische faciliteiten en de kosten om ander zelf transport te organiseren zijn niet op te brengen door de ontheemden. Tevens is de kwaliteit van de diensten zeer slecht door een gebrek aan adequaat personeel, lange wachttijden, het gebrek aan medische apparatuur en medicijnen. Tevens is ondervoeding een groot probleem voor de kindergezondheid in Afghanistan. Bij een screening van 219,796 kinderen onder de 5 in Kandahar en districten werden er 13,722 gevallen van ondervoeding en 3,891gevallen van zware ondervoeding geregistreerd. Dit is onder de WHO drempel, maar recente data van het SC DFATD gefinancierde project survey baseline rapport, uitgevoerd in 2013, geeft aan dat net iets meer dan een derde van de moeders in Kandahar gewone groei monitoring rapporteerde en tweederde van de gemeenschaps gezondheidswerkers rapporteerde dat ze niet wisten hoe ze een diagnose van zware ondervoeding moesten vaststellen of behandelen. Deze informatie is verergerd door de onofficiÃ«le resultaten van de NNS (Nationale voedingssurvey) die een percentage van 5.7% aangaf voor de provincie. Daarbij genomen, de lagere weerbaarheid van ontheemden en het gebrek aan toegang tot gezondheidsdiensten, doet verwachten dat de ondervoedingscijfers in werkelijkheid hoger liggen. De rapid assessment die gedaan is door SC in December geeft duidelijk aan dat een gebrek aan dieet diversiteit en calorie-opname de onderliggende oorzaken zijn. De resultaten van de geÃ¯nterviewde huishoudens laten zien dat 75% van de ontheemden niet in staat is om de nodige energie behoefte te behalen en 63% is niet in staat de helft van de minimale voedselinname te behalen (2100 kcal). Minder dan een derde van de hushoudens consumeerde slechts vier van de zeven essentiÃ«le voedsel groepen en het gemiddelde huishouden verdient 4,096 Afghanis per maand- ruim beneden de overheids armoede grens. Deze groep besteed meer dan 70% van het huishouden inkomen aan voedsel. ;Het verstrekken van levensreddende hulp aan ontheemden en de lokale bevolking en het verbeteren van de gezondheids en voedingsstatus van deze doelgroep, in het bijzonder kinderen en vrouwen, in Kandahar.;De begunstigden van dit project zijn 67.580 mensen (51% man/49% vrouw) zowel ontheemden als de lokale bevolking.",2,,7/1/14,4/30/15,,0,0,0,0,;ECHO;DFATD,,,;Save the Children Afghanistan,,AF,,,,,,RO,,1475,Save the Children Netherlands,goossen.hoenders@savethechildren.nl,en,EUR,9/25/14 8:36,Save the Children Netherlands,NL-KVK-41201463,21,NL-KVK-41201463-PCNSF-003 C,Verbeterde vaardigheden van jongeren ter vergroting kansen op de arbeidsmarkt,"Hoewel de Chinese economie snel groeit de laatste 30 jaar, leven 128 miljoen Chinezen nog steeds in absolute armoede volgens de door de Wereldbank gedefinieerde standaard van 1,25 dollar per dag. Het belang van onderwijs in het tegengaan van de vicieuze cirkel van armoede van de ene generatie op de andere is breed erkend door de Chinese overheid. Sinds 2005 zijn het aantal onderwijsinschrijvingen significant toegenomen, maar in de arme en afgelegen rurale gebieden blijven er problemen op het gebied van onderwijskwaliteit. De provincie Yunnan ligt in het Zuidwesten van China en heeft 46.31 miljoen inwoners en is China's op 3 na armste regio. In deze provincie is lage kwaliteit van het onderwijs Ã©Ã©n van de grootste oorzaken van ongelijkheid en armoede, met toenemende ongelijkheden in de inzetbaarheid van jeugd tussen rurale en stedelijke gebieden. Tevens is 10-15 % van de bevolking analfabeet (Na Tibet, de provincie met het hoogste niveau van analfabetisme). Daarnaast is Yunnan multi-etnisch met een bevolking bestaande uit 51 verschillende etniciteiten. Deze multi-etniciteit zorgt voor barriÃ¨res in het onderwijs systeem, vooral in het basisonderwijs. Dit komt, omdat kinderen les krijgen in het Mandarijn (Chinees) wat voor vele scholieren niet hun moedertaal is. Hoewel de instroom onder etnische gemeenschappen hoog is in de eerste jaren, vallen er een hoop scholieren af door een slechte beheersing van het Mandarijn wat als communicatiemedium wordt gebruikt. De lage onderwijskwaliteit in Yunnan is (verder) te wijten aan de capaciteit van leraren. Deze zijn namelijk niet in staat om in te spelen op de behoeften van kinderen, omdat in meeste gevallen: I) ze niet bevoegd zijn: 2) onvoldoende training hebben gehad voorafgaand aan hun dienstverband; 3) Er weinig tot geen trainingsmogelijkheden zijn tijdens het dienstverband. Dit zorgt voor verouderde leerpraktijken in scholen en activiteiten planningen die, de specifieke behoeften voor wat betreft vaardigheden die de professionele en individuele ontwikkeling van middelbare scholieren zou vergroten, niet in ogenschouw nemen. Het gevolg hiervan is dat kinderen vaak slagen met weinig direct toepasbare vaardigheden en met een basiskennis die de realiteit van het leven in hun gemeenschappen niet weerspiegelt. Slechts enkele kinderen hebben de economische mogelijkheid of steun vanuit familie om door te stromen naar hoger onderwijs of beroepsonderwijs na het voltooien van het voortgezet onderwijs. Dit komt niet alleen door armoede, maar ook door het geringe vertrouwen in onderwijs en toekomstperspectieven. Veel kinderen komen relatief vroeg in aanraking met een leven van volwassenen met alle gevolgen van dien. Door gebrek aan vaardigheden en geletterdheid lopen ze een groter gevaar om in aanraking te komen met mensenhandel, HIV/aids uitbuiting en mishandeling. Daarnaast hebben veel van hen een slecht betaalde baan waarin ze ook uitgebuit worden of raken ze werkeloos. De provincies Yunnan en Guizhou zijn de voornaamste bron provincies voor mensenhandel terwijl Fuijan, Guangdong en Shangdong (de rijkere provincies) de bestemmingen zijn van de binnenlandse mensenhandel. Daarnaast vindt er binnen Yunnan ook veel intra provinciale mensenhandel plaats. De meeste slachtoffers in Yunnan zijn jonge vrouwen die verkocht worden als bruiden aan mannen in meer geÃ¯soleerde gebieden. Dit komt, omdat deze mannen in rurale gebieden de bruidsschat die een formeel huwelijk vereist, niet kunnen betalen. De mensenhandelaar voorziet deze mannen zo van een veel goedkopere bruid. Tevens worden er veel mensen vanuit Yunnan gesmokkeld naar Thailand. En, omdat jonge vrouwen traditioneel minder onderwezen worden dan jongens is deze groep extra kwetsbaar voor uitbuiting. ;Door middel van kennis en vaardigheden jeugd in staat stellen hun levensvooruitzichten te verbeteren en toegang tot een betere toekomst bieden;2000 kinderen met een leeftijd van 11-18 jaar en 360 docenten van 5 scholen in twee rurale en etnische minderheid provincies. Indirecte begunstigden: 4000 ouders/verzorgers.;Although Chinaâ€™s economy has been growing at a fast pace for the last 30 years, 128 million Chinese still live in absolute poverty according to the World Bank standard of $1.25 per day. The importance of education in stopping the cycle of poverty from one generation to the next has been widely recognised by the Chinese government who in 1986 universalised nine-year compulsory education. Since 2005, when the policy was actually implemented at local level, then, enrolment in compulsory education has dramatically increased, but issues remain especially in terms of quality of education in poor remote rural areas. Yunnan province is located in Southwest part of China, with a population of 46.31 million, is ranked third among Chinaâ€™s poorest regions. Here, poor quality of education has become one of the biggest drivers of inequality and poverty, with increasing disparities in employability of youth between rural and urban areas. In Yunnan, teachers are not able to respond to the needs of children as in most cases: 1) they are not qualified; 2) have had inadequate pre-service trainings; 3) in-services training opportunities are rare or non-existent. This translates into obsolete teaching practice in schools and activity plans which donâ€™t take into account the specific needs in terms of hard and soft skills that would benefit the professional and individual development of middle school students. As a result, children often graduate with few directly applicable skills, as well as a knowledge base that does not reflect the realities of life in their communities. Only few children have the economic possibility or family support to continue into high school education or vocational schools after completing compulsory education. This is not only due to poverty, but also little trust in education and prospective for the future. Children therefore tend to step into an adult life at a young age and their lack of skills and literacy, places them at greater risk of harm from trafficking, HIV, conflict with the law and other forms of exploitation and abuse. Many end up either unemployed or exploited in low-paying labour intensive jobs, excluded from urban opportunities throughout their lives and locked in a self-perpetuating situation.;The goal of the project is to empower youth with knowledge and skills they need to improve their life prospects and have access to a better future. ;Direct beneficiaries after year 1: 2,000 children aged 11-18 and 360 teachers from 6 schools in two rural and ethnic minority counties.

Dit draagt bij aan het verbeteren van de veiligheid van de burgers in Afghanistan en Pakistan. Save the Children is al geruime tijd actief in zowel Afghanistan en Pakistan en heeft de afgelopen jaren in beide landen veel geÃ¯nvesteerd in de uitvoeringscapaciteit van omvangrijke meerjarenprogramma\'s. In het bijzonder legt Save the Children zich toe op het creÃ«ren van betere toekomstperspectieven van kinderen in moeilijke omstandigheden door het verlenen van directe hulp en hulp gericht op de naaste omgeving van kinderen. In Afghanistan heeft SCNL zich de afgelopen jaren voornamelijk beziggehouden met het thema onderwijs en wel voor jongens en meisjes die niet of nauwelijks toegang hadden tot het basis onderwijs. Scholing werden dichterbij aangeleverd in de verschillende gemeenschappen - ook door community participatie, en ook werd er door het Accelerated Learning (AL) voor aansluiting gezorgd bij het reguliere basisonderwijs. Ook werd er aandacht besteed aan de bouw en inrichting van scholen, en beurzen voor huidige en toekomstige onderwijzenden (toegang, kwaliteit). Daarnaast is er aandacht voor de bevordering van kinderrechten en het bieden van vakonderwijs aan werkende kinderen, investering in counseling en behandeling van drugsverslaafden (vnl opium). In Pakistan heeft SCNL zich voornamelijk bezig gehouden met noodhulp en wederopbouw (ten gevolge van overstromingen en aardbeving), als ook in de twee huidige programma\'s op het thema onderwijs. In het district Baluchistan wordt op dit moment het Baluchistan Education Programme uitgevoerd, wat zich sterk maakt voor toegang tot (inclusief ECE) en kwaliteit van basisonderwijs en hoger onderwijs in 3 districten, planning van onderwijs systemen en budgetering door de overheid, en bevorderen van gezondheid & hygiene op alle 340 scholen in het programma (73,000 kinderen). Door de onveiligheid en weersomstandigheden heeft de bouw van de scholen vertraging opgelopen, maar andere delen van het programma, waaronder ook conflict management, hebben wel plaatsgevonden. Zes maanden geleden is het Programme Establishing Partnership and Stability (PEPAS) van start gegaan in het noordelijke district Battagram, die zicht richt op basis en middelbaar onderwijs (toegang en kwaliteit), inclusief onderdeel voor madrassas, in 260 scholen, met daarnaast ook een livelihood (verbeterde omstandigheden in levensonderhoud voor 300 jongeren) en advocacy component. Het is verwacht dat de onderwijs en livelihood componenten zullen bijdragen aan vrede en veiligheid in het district. In zowel Afghanistan en Pakistan is de huidige situatie in de verschillende provincies niet stabiel. Voor beiden geldt dat conflicten over grenzen, grondgebieden, en natuurlijke bronnen (schaarse bronnen) en ten tweede gebrek aan governance in lokale en nationale overheidsstructuren. Onveiligheid door aanslagen of door sectorial killings, dan wel ontvoeringen hebben en blijven van invloed op het uitvoeren van de programma activiteiten. Daarnaast zijn het vertrek van troepen uit en minder beschikbare fondsen in Afghanistan van invloed op de algehele stabiliteit. In Pakistan is de onveiligheid in vnl de grensgebieden met Afghanistan (FATA areas) en ook in het westen (Baluchistan) groot, en in de aanloop op de verkiezingen in 2012 worden deze niet minder. De grensgebieden worden ook wel \'\'cash insecure regions\'\' genoemd, door gebrek aan land voor landbouwgebruik, gebrek aan industrien en gebrek aan werkgelegenheid. ;Doel van het programma is om de kennis en de capaciteit van overheidsfunctionarissen te versterken wat bijdraagt aan een betere dienstverlening van de overheid. Daarnaast beoogt het programma jongeren en vrouwen in staat te stellen deel te nemen aan de sociale en economische ontwikkeling van Afghanistan en Pakistan. Door zich in te zetten op het verbeteren van de zwakke structuren in de gemeenschappen, dan wel die van de overheidsorganen kan de onveiligheid verminderen. Door het blijven implementeren van onderwijs en ook andere thematische projecten beoogd SC dat deze bijdragen aan stabiliteit en veiligheid in de gemeenschappen. Activiteiten zoals inkomensverbetering en vakonderwijs, specifiek voor vrouwen en jongeren zullen hieraan bijdragen. Ook capaciteitsopbouw van lokale overheden zal een kwaliteitsverbetering teweegbrengen in het bieden van basic services. Daarnaast zullen door het organiseren van cross border workshops voor overheidsfunctionarissen, geleerde lessen gedeeld worden. ;Social empowerment van vrouwen en jongeren door het opstarten van income generation activities, het verzorgen van trainingen om de duurzaamheid van het voorgaande te vergroten en de mogelijkheid te bieden aan vrouwen en jongeren om samen te werken als groep, en om zodanig hun eigen economische situatie te verbeteren. Uit lessons learned van een recente evaluatie, wordt ook meegenomen dat duurzaamheid vooral wordt verkregen door langere trainings periodes in te bouwen, zich met name richten op vrouwen, en zich specifiek te richten op communities. daarnaast is het van belanfg om lokale overheden nauw te betrekken en ook deel te laten nemen aan markt surveys, basline surveys, ontwikkeling van duurzame livelihoods en income generating activities, en best practices voor voedselzekerheid en livelihood, als ook innovatieve strategien. Ook zullen door training op basic hygiene en nutrition, zullen huishoudens betere beslissingen kunnen nemen. - 80 overheidsfunctionarissen - 6.353 jongeren en vrouwen - 80 gemeenschappen",2,,10/1/12,7/31/15,,0,120000,0,0,;Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken,,,;Save the Children International,,AF,100,Nangarhar and Sar-i-Pul,679,100,;;;;Hieronder vallen activiteiten die niet zijn toe te rekenen aan een bepaalde sector.;;;Hieronder vallen activiteiten die niet zijn toe te rekenen aan een bepaalde sector.;;;;Hieronder vallen activiteiten die niet zijn toe te rekenen aan een bepaalde sector.;;,DAC;RO;RO;RO;RO;RO;RO;RO;DAC;RO;RO;RO;DAC;DAC,11330;;;;;;;;11230;;;;11230;15140,50;2;2;77;21;2;77;21;20;2;77;21;30;201679,Mifumi UK,developlink@rocketmail.com,en,GBP,12/13/14 15:30,Mifumi UK,GB-CHC-1038785,21,GB-CHC-1038785-MCHKenya,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1488,UTZ Certified,elisa.trepp@utzcertified.org,en,EUR,9/23/14 14:30,UTZ Certified,NL-KVK-34159275,30,NL-KVK-34159275-FDOVNIC,Access to Sustainable Markets and Food Security for Nicaraguaâ€™s Coffee and Cocoa producers,"The purpose of the project is to increase the income, improve food security and living conditions of 5,000 small coffee and cocoa producers and their families, linked to the supply chain of Atlantic Exporter.

The Discovery Project is empowering teachers and families of marginalized children to raise the quality of education and prioritize access for all children. The Discovery Project advances education through: â€¢ Improving student outcomes in literacy and numeracy (impacting 126,000 students). â€¢ Improving the quality of education through media in the classroom and teacher professional development (reaching 11,900 teachers and 841,000 students in 1,500 schools). â€¢ Community training and engagement activities designed to address gender marginalization, including the formation of clubs to connect out-of-school youth with educational opportunities where they are and support access to education. â€¢ National talk shows that will use an entertaining medium to shift knowledge, attitudes and practices around education, (broadcast to over 10,000,000 people). Using a cost-effective, research-based approach and technology-driven development that is scalable, sustainable and proven to help attain educational goals, the Discovery Project will get more girls and boys in school, keep them in school and make sure they are learning when they get there.
